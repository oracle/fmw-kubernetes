# Automating the Identity and Access Management Enterprise Disaster Recovery

A number of sample scripts have been developed which allow you to deploy Oracle Identity and Access Management Disaster recovery. These scripts are provided as samples for you to use to develop your own applications.

You must ensure that you are using the October 2023 or later release of Identity and Access Management for this utility to work.

The main script enable_dr.sh is designed to be run on each site, that is to say run it on the Primary then Run it on the Standby.

The scripts can be run from any host which has access to the local Kubernetes cluster. 

The scripts work by taking a backup of objects on the primary site and restoring them on the standby.

If you wish the scripts to automatically copy backup files between your primary and standby deployment hosts then you must have passwordless ssh set up between your two deployment hosts.

These scripts are provided as examples and can be customized as desired.

## Obtaining the Scripts

The automation scripts are available for download from GitHub.

To obtain the scripts, use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git
```

The scripts appear in the following directory:

```
fmw-kubernetes/FMWKubernetesMAA/OracleEnterpriseDeploymentAutomation/OracleIdentityManagement/14c
```

Move these template scripts to your working directory. For example:

```
cp -R fmw-kubernetes/FMWKubernetesMAA/OracleEnterpriseDeploymentAutomation/OracleIdentityManagement/14c/* /workdir/scripts
```


## Scope
This section lists the actions that the scripts perform as part of the deployment process. It also lists the tasks the scripts do not perform.

### What the Scripts Will do

The scripts will enable disaster recovery for Oracle Unified Directory (OUD), Oracle Access Manager (OAM), Oracle Identity Governance (OIG), Oracle Identity Role Intelligence (OIRI), Oracle Advanced Authentication (OAA) and Oracle HTTP Servers.

The scripts perform the following actions:

* Create a backup job to periodically take a backup of the persistent volumes associated with an application and transfer these files to a staging area on your standby system.
* Create a restore job to periodically restore the PV backup to the standby site, modifying database connection information and Kubernetes access files as needed.
* Use the MAA Kubernetes Snapshot tool to take a backup of the Kubernetes Objects in the application namespace.
* Use the MAA Kubernetes Snapshot tool to restore the backup of the Kubernetes Objects to the same namespace on the standby system.
* If the MAA Kubernetes Snapshot tool is not being used then they will sanitize the deployment created on the standby system, prior to Syncing with the primary.
* Backup the Oracle HTTP Server configuration on the primary, and restore it on the standby making routing updates as needed.
* Provide Management Operations on the Primary and Standby Sites including:
    * Manually running and instantiation Job.
    * Start and Stop s deployment
    * Suspend and Resume the Cronjob's responsible for PV Synchronization.
    * Change the role of a site to reverse the direction on the PV Synchronization.

### What the Scripts Will Not Do

While the scripts perform the majority of the deployment, they do not perform the following tasks:

* Deploy Container Runtime Environment, Kubernetes, or Helm.
* Configure load balancer, and ensure that any SSL certificates are consistent between the load balancers on the Primary and Standby Systems.
* Deploy your Primary Site.
* Install the WebLogic Operator.
* Install Ingress.
* Install Oracle HTTP Server.
* Create a Dataguard database on the Standby Site.
* Enable Disaster Recovery for Prometheus and Grafana.
* Enable Disaster Recovery for Elastic Search and Kibana.


## Key Concepts of the Scripts

To make things simple and easy to manage the scripts are based around two concepts:

* A response file with details of your environment.
* Template files you can easily modify or add to as required.

> Note: Scripts are reentrant, if something fails it can be restarted at the point at which it failed.


## Getting Started

All operations are controlled via two scripts which are located in the utils directory.

* enable_dr.sh - This script takes one parameter, the product.   Valid products are ohs, oud, oam, oig, oaa and oiri.   

 For example, to enable DR for OAM
 
 On the Primary Site

 ```
 utils/enable_dr.sh oam
 ```
 
 Then on the Standby Site
 
 ```
 utils/enable_dr.sh oam
 ```
 
* idmdrctl.sh - This script takes two arguments.

    -a Action
    -p Product
    
    Valid Actions are:
    
    * initial (Create initialization job)
    * switch (Switch the sites role STANDBY/PRIMARY)
    * stop (Stop a deployment)
    * start (Start a deployment)
    * suspend (Suspend the PV backup/restore job)
    * resume (Resume the PV backup/restore job)

    Valid products are
    
    * oud
    * oam
    * oig
    * oaa
    * oiri

 For example, to shutdown OAM issue the command:

 ```
 utils/idmdrctl.sh -a stop -p oam
 ```

## Creating a Response File

Sample response and password files are created for you in the `responsefile` directory. You can edit these files.  The files can be edited directly.


Values are stored in the files `dr.rsp` and `.drpwd` 

> Note: 
> * The file consists of key/value pairs. There should be no spaces between the name of the key and its value. For example:
> `Key=value`
>* If you are using complex passwords, that is, passwords which contain characters such as `!`, `*`, and `$`, then these characters must be separated by a `\`. For example: 'hello!$' should be entered as `hello\!\$`. 

> Note: The reference sections below detail all parameters.  Parameters associated with passwords are stored in a hidden file in the same directory.  This is an added security measure.

## Log Files

The enable_dr.sh script creates log files in the Directory \<WORKDIR\>/\<PRODUCT\>/DR in a `logs` sub-directory. This directory also contains the following two files:

* `progressfile` – This file contains the last successfully executed step. If you want to restart the process at a different step, update this file.

* `timings.log` – This file is used for informational purposes to show how much time was spent on each stage of the provisioning process.

For example:
/workdir/OAM/DR/logs


## Reference – Response File

The following sections describe the parameters in the response file that is used to control the provisioning of the various products in the Kubernetes cluster. The parameters are divided into generic and product-specific parameters.
