# Automating the Creation of an OCI Infrastructure for the Identity and Access Management Kubernetes Cluster

When following the Enterprise Deployment Guide for setting up an  Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster chapter 9 presents many security lists, hosts, VCN's and related resources that need to be created for a successful deployment. This utility consists of a number of sample scripts designed to automate this configuration, making use of the OCI command-line interface.

These scripts are provided as examples and can be customized as desired.

See the ["Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster"](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/12.2.1.4/ikedg/preparing-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-enterprise-deployment.html#GUID-3782C6F9-8F6C-4763-BC54-7E6E8D976726) chapter 9 for more details.

## Obtaining the Scripts
The scripts are included with the EDG Automation scripts.  The automation scripts are available for download from GitHub.

To obtain the scripts, use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git
```

The scripts appear in the following directory:

```
fmw-kubernetes/FMWKubernetesMAA/OracleEnterpriseDeploymentAutomation/OracleIdentityManagement/oke_utils
```

Copy these template scripts to your working directory. For example:

```cp -R fmw-kubernetes/FMWKubernetesMAA/OracleEnterpriseDeploymentAutomation/OracleIdentityManagement/* /workdir/scripts```

This directory will be referred to `SCRIPTDIR` in the remainder of this document.


## Scope
This section lists the actions that the scripts perform as part of the deployment process. It also lists the tasks the scripts do not perform.
### What the Script Will do
The script completes chapters 9 and 10 from the Enterprise Deployment Guide. This includes:

* Creating a Bastion host
* Creating 2 Compute instance for the Oracle HTTP Server
* Creating the NFS file systems and mount points for the Kubernetes persistent volume data
* Create a public and internal load balancer for routing requests to the OHS servers
* Creates a TCP load balancer to route requests to the Kubernetes nodes
* Create the RAC database used for the Identity Management product schemas
* Create a DNS server for name resolution within the Kubernetes cluster
* Tunes the RAC database as mentioned in the EDG
* Install the Java Server and Oracle Text database options which are required by the OIM server
* Install the XA views into the OIM pluggable database
* Creates pluggable databases, as configured, for the OAM, OIM, OAA, and OIRI schemas
* Creates database services for the above pluggable databases

### What the Script Will Not Do
The script does not include the installation of any monitoring software such as Grafana or Prometheus nor does it install or configure the log file monitoring tools Elasticsearch and Kibana.

## Key Concepts of the Scripts

To make things simple and easy to manage the scripts are based around the following concepts:

* A response file with details of your environment.
* Template files you can easily modify or add to as required.
* The scripts can be run from any host which has access to the Kubernetes cluster.

> Note: Provisioning scripts are re-entrant, if something fails it can be restarted at the point at which it failed.
 
## Pre-requisites

Before running the utility ensure that the following Pre-Requisites are in place:

* Install and configure the OCI command-line tools using KM note 2432759.1 or the official [OCI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm).
* Ensure that the 'oci' command runs properly by executing the command `oci iam availability-domain list` and checking that valid output is returned.
* Create an SSH private/public key that will be used to access the OCI instances using the Linux command `ssh-keygen`.
* Create a configuration response file defining the parameters desired for this EDG installation using the delivered `oci-oke.rsp` file as an example.
* You have enough quota available in your tenancy to create the various resources.
 
## Creating a Response File

A Sample response file is created for you in the `SCRIPT_DIR/oke_utils/responsefile` directory called `oci-oke.rsp` and `.ocipwd`. You can edit this file or make a copy of it to another file in the same directory.

All parameters in the section  `MANDATORY PARAMETERS` should be carefully reviewed and set as appropriate. Some values include reasonable default values while others are installation dependent and require to be explictly set.

This file will be referenced as `TEMPLATE_NAME` in the rest of this document.

Please enter sensitive data like ssh key path and DB passwords in the `SCRIPT_DIR/oke_utils/responsefile` directory called `.ocipwd'.

**Notes:**  
> The file consists of key/value pairs. There should be no spaces between the name of the key and its value. For example: Key=value.

> The OCI image names change frequently and may be out-of-date and require an update before any of the instances can be successfully created.


## Provisioning the Environment
Run the provision script by executing the following commands.

```
cd $SCRIPT_DIR/oke_utils
./provision_oke.sh <TEMPLATE_NAME>
```

> Note: The provision script runs non-interactively after first asking for confirmation that the listed compartment should be used to install the OCI components. Output from the script is printed to the screen as well as into the provision\_oci.log file.
 
## Log Files

The provisioning scripts create log files for each product inside the working directory in a `TEMPLATE_NAME/logs` sub-directory. This directory contains the following files:

* `progressfile` – This file contains the last successfully executed step. If you want to restart the process at a different step, update this file.

* `timings.log` – This file is used for informational purposes to show how much time was spent on each stage of the provisioning process.

* `provision_oci.log` - This file is used to capture the output from the execution of the various `oci` commands that were run by the `provision_oke.sh` script. This is the main provisioning log file.  


## Output Files

These files are generated as part of the provisioning process.

| **Filename** | **Contents** | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/ca.crt | The self-signed certificate authority SSL certificate. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/ca.csr | The certificate authority signing request which can be helpful when needing to renew the CA certificate. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/ca.key | The self-signed certificate authority SSL private key. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/ca.srl | The openssl serial number using when signing the CA certificate. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/TEMPLATE\_NAME.ocid | A listing that includes all of the resources created by the script and their associated OCID value. This file is used when the `delete_oke.sh` script is run to know which resources to delete. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/loadbalancer.crt | The self-signed SSL certificate used by the public and internal load balancers. This file is also used by the OAM WebGate for making an SSL connection to public load balancer. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/loadbalancer.key | The SSL private key for the public/internal load balancer SSL certificate. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/bastion\_mounts.sh | A bash shell script that can be run manually to mount the NFS volumes on the Bastion host. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/webhost1\_mounts.sh | A bash shell script that can be run manually to mount the NFS volumes on WebHost1. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/webhost2\_mounts.sh | A bash shell script that can be run manually to mount the NFS volumes on WebHost2. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/db-tuning.sh | A bash schell script that can be run manually to configure the database init.ora parameters for the selected memory size defined by the `DB_MEMORY_CONFIG` parameter. |

| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/interim_parameters | A listing that includes gathered information during provisioning, needed for faster processing. |




### Deleting the Environment
The deletion script will read the `$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/output/TEMPLATE_NAME.ocid` file to determine which resources were created by the provisioning script and attempt to delete them. 
Run the deletion script by executing the following commands.

```
cd $SCRIPT_DIR/oke_utils
./delete_oke.sh <TEMPLATE_NAME>
```
Like the provisioning script, the delete script will first confirm that the resources should be deleted from the listed compartment and then proceed to run without further user input to delete the resources.

### Deletion Output Files

| :--- | :--- | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/logs/delete\_oke.log | The output from the execution of the various `oci` commands that were run by the `delete_oke.sh` script. This is the main deletion log file. | 
| \$WORKDIR/TEMPLATE_NAME/logs/timings.log | This file is used for informational purposes to show how much time was spent on each stage of the deletion process. |
