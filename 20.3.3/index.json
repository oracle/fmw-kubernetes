	"content": "This section provides information about the system requirements and limitations for deploying and running Oracle SOA Suite domains with the WebLogic Kubernetes operator.\nSystem requirements for Oracle SOA Suite domains For the current production release 20.3.3:\n Oracle Linux 7 (UL6+) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (UL3+ only with standalone Kubernetes) are supported. Kubernetes 1.14.8+, 1.15.7+, 1.16.0+, 1.17.0+, and 1.18.0+ (check with kubectl version). Docker 18.09.1ce+, 19.03.1+ (check with docker version) or CRI-O 1.14.7 (check with crictl version | grep RuntimeVersion). Flannel networking v0.9.1-amd64 or later (check with docker images | grep flannel). Helm 3.1.3+ (check with helm version --client --short). Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes operator 3.0.1 (see operator releases page). Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4 Docker image downloaded from My Oracle Support (MOS patch 31966923). This image contains the latest bundle patch and one-off patches for Oracle SOA Suite. You must have the cluster-admin role to install the operator. The operator does not need the cluster-admin role at runtime. We do not currently support running SOA in non-Linux containers. Additionally, see the Oracle SOA Suite documentation for other requirements such as database version.  See here for resourse sizing information for Oracle SOA Suite domains setup on Kubernetes cluster.\nLimitations Compared to running a WebLogic Server domain in Kubernetes using the operator, the following limitations currently exist for Oracle SOA Suite domains:\n In this release, Oracle SOA Suite domains are supported using the domain on a persistent volume model only, where the domain home is located in a persistent volume (PV). The \u0026ldquo;domain in image\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;model in image\u0026rdquo; models are not supported. Also, \u0026ldquo;WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT)\u0026rdquo; based deployments are currently not supported. Only configured clusters are supported. Dynamic clusters are not supported for Oracle SOA Suite domains. Note that you can still use all of the scaling features, but you need to define the maximum size of your cluster at domain creation time. Mixed clusters (configured servers targeted to a dynamic cluster) are not supported. The WebLogic Logging Exporter currently supports WebLogic Server logs only. Other logs will not be sent to Elasticsearch. Note, however, that you can use a sidecar with a log handling tool like Logstash or Fluentd to get logs. The WebLogic Monitoring Exporter currently supports WebLogic MBean trees only. Support for JRF and Oracle SOA Suite MBeans is not available. Also, a metrics dashboard specific to Oracle SOA Suite is not available. Instead, use the WebLogic Server dashboard to monitor the Oracle SOA Suite server metrics in Grafana. Some features such as multicast, multitenancy, production redeployment, and Node Manager (although it is used internally for the liveness probe and to start WebLogic Server instances) are not supported in this release. Features such as Java Messaging Service whole server migration, consensus leasing, and maximum availability architecture (Oracle SOA Suite EDG setup) are not supported in this release. Enabling or disabling the memory resiliency for Oracle Service Bus using the Enterprise Manager Console is not supported in this release.  For up-to-date information about the features of WebLogic Server that are supported in Kubernetes environments, see My Oracle Support Doc ID 2349228.1.\n"

	"description": "Deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper to Oracle SOA Suite in the WebLogic Kubernetes operator environment.",
	"content": "Learn how to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper (running outside the Kubernetes network) to an Oracle SOA Suite instance in the WebLogic Kubernetes operator environment.\nUse JDeveloper for development and test environments only. For a production environment, you should deploy using Application Control and WLST methods.\n Deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications to Oracle SOA Suite from JDeveloper To deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper, the Administration Server must be configured to expose a T3 channel. The WebLogic Kubernetes operator provides an option to expose a T3 channel for the Administration Server using the exposeAdminT3Channel setting during domain creation, then the matching T3 service can be used to connect. By default, when exposeAdminT3Channel is set, the WebLogic Kubernetes operator environment exposes the NodePort for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint at 30012 (use t3ChannelPort to configure the port to a different value).\nIf you miss enabling exposeAdminT3Channel during domain creation, follow Expose a T3/T3S Channel for the Administration Server to expose a T3 channel manually.\nPrerequisites   Get the Kubernetes cluster master address and verify the T3 port that will be used for creating application server connections. Use the following command to get the T3 port:\n$ kubectl get service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;AdministrationServerName\u0026gt;-external -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;-o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}' For example:\n$ kubectl get service soainfra-adminserver-external -n soana-o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'   Oracle SOA Suite in the WebLogic Kubernetes operator environment is deployed in a Reference Configuration domain. If a SOA project is developed in Classic mode JDeveloper displays a Mismatch notification in the Deploy Composite Wizard. By default, JDeveloper is in Classic mode. To develop SOA projects in Reference Configuration mode, you must manually enable this feature in JDeveloper: a. From the File menu, select Tools, then Preferences. b. Select Reference Configuration Settings. c. Select Enable Reference Configuration settings in adapters.\n  JDeveloper needs to access the Servers during deployment. In the WebLogic Kubernetes operator environment, Administration and Managed Servers are pods and cannot be accessed directly by JDeveloper. As a workaround, you must configure the reachability of the Managed Servers:\nThe Managed Server T3 port is not exposed by default and opening this will have a security risk as the authentication method here is based on a userid/password. It is not recommended to do this on production instances.\n   Decide on an external IP address to be used to configure access to the Managed Servers. Master or worker node IP address can be used to configure Managed Server reachability. In these steps, the Kubernetes cluster master IP is used for demonstration.\n  Get the pod names of the Administration Server and Managed Servers (that is, \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;server name\u0026gt;), which will be used to map in /etc/hosts.\n  Update /etc/hosts (or in Windows, C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts) on the host where JDeveloper is running with the entries below, where\n\u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Administration Server pod name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Managed Server1 pod name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Managed Server2 pod name\u0026gt; Sample /etc/hosts entries looks as follows, where X.X.X.X is the master node IP address:\nX.X.X.X soainfra-adminserver X.X.X.X soainfra-soa-server1 X.X.X.X soainfra-soa-server2   Get the Kubernetes service name of the Oracle SOA Suite cluster to access externally with the master IP (or external IP):\n$ kubectl get service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get service soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster -n soans   Create a Kubernetes service to expose the Oracle SOA Suite cluster service (\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt;) externally with same port as the Managed Server:\n$ kubectl expose service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt; --name \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt;-ext --external-ip=\u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl expose service soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster --name soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster-ext --external-ip=X.X.X.X -n soans  In a production environment, exposing the SOA cluster service with an external IP address is not recommended, as it can cause message drops on the SOA Managed Servers.\n     Create an application server connection in JDeveloper   Create a new application server connection (for example wls-k8s-op-connection) in JDeveloper:   In the configuration page, provide the WebLogic Hostname as the Kubernetes Master Address.\n  Update the Port as the T3 port (default is 30012) obtained in Prerequisites.\n  Enter the WebLogic Domain value (domainUID).\n  Test the connection to verify it is successful.   Deploy SOA composite applications using JDeveloper   In JDeveloper, right-click the SOA project you want to deploy and select Deploy to display the deployment wizard.   In the Deployment Action page, select Deploy to Application Server and click Next.   In the Deployment Configuration page, select the appropriate options and click Next.   In the Select server page, select the application server connection (wls-k8s-op-connection) that was created earlier and click Next.   If the Prerequisites were configured correctly, the lookup discovers the Managed Servers for deploying the composite.   Using the application server connection, the Managed Servers (Oracle SOA Suite cluster) are listed on the SOA Servers page. Select the Oracle SOA Suite cluster and click Next.   On the Summary page, click Finish to start deploying the composites to the Oracle SOA Suite cluster.   Verify logs on JDeveloper to confirm successful deployment.   Enter the soa-infra URLs in a browser to confirm the composites are deployed on both servers of the Oracle SOA Suite cluster.   Deploy Oracle Service Bus composite applications using JDeveloper   In JDeveloper, right-click the Oracle Service Bus project you want to deploy and select Deploy to display the deployment wizard.   In the Deployment Action page, select Deploy to Application Server and click Next.   In the Select Server page, select the application server connection (wls-k8s-op-connection) that was created earlier and click Next.   On the Summary page, click Finish to start deploying the composites to the Oracle Service Bus cluster.   In JDeveloper, verify logs to confirm successful deployment.   In the Oracle Service Bus Console, click Launch Test Console to verify that the Oracle Service Bus composite application is deployed successfully.   "

It is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to patch the Oracle SOA Suite image.\n Recommendations:\n Use the WebLogic Image Tool create feature for patching the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a bundle patch and multiple interim patches. This is the recommended approach because it optimizes the size of the image. Use the WebLogic Image Tool update feature for patching the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.

Note that this walkthrough is for demonstration purposes only, not for use in production. These instructions assume that you are already familiar with Kubernetes. If you need more detailed instructions, refer to the Install Guide.\nHardware requirements Supported Linux kernel for deploying and running Oracle SOA Suite domains with the operator is Oracle Linux 7 (UL6+) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (UL3+ only with standalone Kubernetes). Refer to the prerequisites for more details.\nFor this exercise the minimum hardware requirement to create a single node Kubernetes cluster and then deploy soaessosb (domain with SOA, OSB, and ESS) domain type with one managed server for SOA and one for OSB Cluster running along with Oracle Database running as a container\n   Hardware Size     RAM 32GB   Disk Space 250GB+   CPU core(s) 6    See here for resourse sizing information for Oracle SOA Suite domains setup on Kubernetes cluster.\nSet up Oracle SOA Suite in an on-premise environment Perform the steps in this topic to create a single instance on-premise Kubernetes cluster and then create an Oracle SOA Suite soaessosb domain type, which deploys a domain with Oracle Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Oracle Service Bus (OSB), and Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS).\n Step 1 - Prepare a virtual machine for the Kubernetes cluster Step 2 - Set up a single instance Kubernetes cluster Step 3 - Get scripts and images Step 4 - Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Step 5 - Install the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer Step 6 - Create and configure an Oracle SOA Suite Domain  1. Prepare a virtual machine for the Kubernetes cluster For illustration purposes, these instructions are for Oracle Linux 7u6+. If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to adjust the steps accordingly.\nThese steps must be run with the root user, unless specified otherwise. Any time you see YOUR_USERID in a command, you should replace it with your actual userid.\n 1.1 Prerequisites   Choose the directories where your Docker and Kubernetes files will be stored. The Docker directory should be on a disk with a lot of free space (more than 100GB) because it will be used for the Docker file system, which contains all of your images and containers. The Kubernetes directory is used for the /var/lib/kubelet file system and persistent volume storage.\n$ export docker_dir=/u01/docker $ export kubelet_dir=/u01/kubelet $ mkdir -p $docker_dir $kubelet_dir $ ln -s $kubelet_dir /var/lib/kubelet   Verify that IPv4 forwarding is enabled on your host.\nNote: Replace eth0 with the ethernet interface name of your compute resource if it is different.\n$ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s 'net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding' $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s 'net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding' $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s 'net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding' $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s 'net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind' For example: Verify that all are set to 1\n$ net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1 Solution: Set all values to 1 immediately with the following commands:\n$ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1 To preserve the settings post-reboot: Update the above values to 1 in files in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/, /run/sysctl.d/, and /etc/sysctl.d/\n  Verify the iptables rule for forwarding.\nKubernetes uses iptables to handle many networking and port forwarding rules. A standard Docker installation may create a firewall rule that prevents forwarding.\nVerify if the iptables rule to accept forwarding traffic is set:\n$ /sbin/iptables -L -n | awk '/Chain FORWARD / {print $4}' | tr -d \u0026quot;)\u0026quot; If the output is \u0026ldquo;DROP\u0026rdquo;, then run the following command:\n$ /sbin/iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT Verify if the iptables rule is set properly to \u0026ldquo;ACCEPT\u0026rdquo;:\n$ /sbin/iptables -L -n | awk '/Chain FORWARD / {print $4}' | tr -d \u0026quot;)\u0026quot;   Disable and stop firewalld:\n$ systemctl disable firewalld $ systemctl stop firewalld   1.2 Install and configure Docker  Note : If you have already installed Docker with version 18.03+ and configured Docker daemon root to sufficient disk space along with proxy settings, continue to Install and configure Kubernetes\n   Make sure that you have the right operating system version:\n$ uname -a $ more /etc/oracle-release For example:\nLinux xxxxxxx 4.1.12-124.27.1.el7uek.x86_64 #2 SMP Mon May 13 08:56:17 PDT 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Oracle Linux Server release 7.6   Install the latest docker-engine and start the Docker service:\n$ yum-config-manager --enable ol7_addons $ yum install docker-engine $ systemctl enable docker $ systemctl start docker   Add your userid to the Docker group. This will allow you to run the Docker commands without root access:\n$ /sbin/usermod -a -G docker \u0026lt;YOUR_USERID\u0026gt;   Check your Docker version.

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \u0026quot;hello-world\u0026quot; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

After the next step, the node will show status as Ready.\n   Install a pod network add-on (flannel) so that your pods can communicate with each other.\n Note: If you are using a different cidr block than 10.244.0.0/16, then download and update kube-flannel.yml with the correct cidr address before deploying into the cluster:\n $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/v0.12.0/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml   Verify that the master node is in Ready status:\n$ kubectl get nodes For example:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION mymasternode Ready master 8m26s v1.18.4 or:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system For example:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/coredns-86c58d9df4-58p9f 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/coredns-86c58d9df4-mzrr5 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/etcd-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 3m4s pod/kube-apiserver-node 1/1 Running 0 3m21s pod/kube-controller-manager-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 3m25s pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-6npx4 1/1 Running 0 49s pod/kube-proxy-4vsgm 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/kube-scheduler-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 2m58s   To schedule pods on the master node, taint the node:\n$ kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-   Congratulations! Your Kubernetes cluster environment is ready to deploy your Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nFor additional references on Kubernetes cluster setup, check the cheat sheet.\n3. Get scripts and images 3.1 Set up the code repository to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains Follow these steps to set up the source code repository required to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains.\n3.2 Get required Docker images and add them to your local registry   If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have one, obtain a Docker store account, log in to the Docker store, and accept the license agreement for the WebLogic Server image.\n  Log in to the Docker store from your Docker client:\n$ docker login   Pull the operator image:\n$ docker pull oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.0.1   Obtain the Oracle Database image and Oracle SOA Suite Docker image from the Oracle Container Registry:\na. For first time users, to pull an image from the Oracle Container Registry, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in using the Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication service. If you do not already have SSO credentials, click the Sign In link at the top of the page to create them.\nUse the web interface to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions for the Oracle software images that you intend to deploy. Your acceptance of these terms are stored in a database that links the software images to your Oracle Single Sign-On login credentials.\nTo obtain the image, log in to the Oracle Container Registry:\n$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com b. Find and then pull the Oracle Database image for 12.2.0.1:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim c. Find and then pull the prebuilt Oracle SOA Suite image 12.2.1.4 install image:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4  Note: This image does not contain any Oracle SOA Suite product patches and can only be used for test and development purposes.\n   4. Install the WebLogic Kubernetes operator 4.1 Prepare for the WebLogic Kubernetes operator.   Create a namespace opns for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns   Create a service account op-sa for the operator in the operator’s namespace:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa   4.2 Install the WebLogic Kubernetes operator Use Helm to install and start the operator from the directory you just cloned:\n $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --namespace opns \\ --set image=oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.0.1 \\ --set serviceAccount=op-sa \\ --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={}\u0026quot; \\ --wait 4.3 Verify the WebLogic Kubernetes operator   Verify that the operator’s pod is running by listing the pods in the operator’s namespace. You should see one for the operator:\n$ kubectl get pods -n opns   Verify that the operator is up and running by viewing the operator pod\u0026rsquo;s logs:\n$ kubectl logs -n opns -c weblogic-operator deployments/weblogic-operator   The WebLogic Kubernetes operator v3.0.1 has been installed. Continue with the load balancer and Oracle SOA Suite domain setup.\n5. Install the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes operator supports three load balancers: Traefik, Voyager, and Apache. Samples are provided in the documentation.\nThis Quick Start demonstrates how to install the Traefik ingress controller to provide load balancing for an Oracle SOA Suite domain.\n  Create a namespace for Traefik:\n$ kubectl create namespace traefik   Set up Helm for 3rd party services:\n$ helm repo add traefik https://containous.github.io/traefik-helm-chart   Install the Traefik operator in the traefik namespace with the provided sample values:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator $ helm install traefik traefik/traefik \\ --namespace traefik \\ --values kubernetes/samples/scripts/charts/traefik/values.yaml \\ --set \u0026quot;kubernetes.namespaces={traefik}\u0026quot; \\ --set \u0026quot;service.type=NodePort\u0026quot; \\ --wait   6. Create and configure an Oracle SOA Suite domain 6.1 Prepare for an Oracle SOA Suite domain   Create a namespace that can host Oracle SOA Suite domains:\n$ kubectl create namespace soans   Use Helm to configure the operator to manage Oracle SOA Suite domains in this namespace:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator $ helm upgrade weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --reuse-values \\ --namespace opns \\ --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={soans}\u0026quot; \\ --wait   Create Kubernetes secrets.\na. Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain. In this example, the username is weblogic, the password in Welcome1, and the namespace is soans:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh \\ -u weblogic \\ -p Welcome1 \\ -n soans \\ -d soainfra \\ -s soainfra-domain-credentials b. Create a Kubernetes secret for the RCU in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n Schema user : SOA1 Schema password : Oradoc_db1 DB sys user password : Oradoc_db1 Domain name : soainfra Domain Namespace : soans Secret name : soainfra-rcu-credentials  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-credentials $ ./create-rcu-credentials.sh \\ -u SOA1 \\ -p Oradoc_db1 \\ -a sys \\ -q Oradoc_db1 \\ -d soainfra \\ -n soans \\ -s soainfra-rcu-credentials   Create the Kubernetes persistence volume and persistence volume claim.\na. Create the Oracle SOA Suite domain home directory. Determine if a user already exists on your host system with uid:gid of 1000:\n$ sudo getent passwd 1000 If this command returns a username (which is the first field), you can skip the following useradd command. If not, create the oracle user with useradd:\n$ sudo useradd -u 1000 -g 1000 oracle Create the directory that will be used for the Oracle SOA Suite domain home:\n$ sudo mkdir /scratch/k8s_dir $ sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /scratch/k8s_dir b. Update create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml with the following values:\n baseName: domain domainUID: soainfra namespace: soans weblogicDomainStoragePath: /scratch/k8s_dir  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:baseName\\: weblogic-sample:baseName\\: domain:g\u0026quot; create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:domainUID\\::domainUID\\: soainfra:g\u0026quot; create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:namespace\\: default:namespace\\: soans:g\u0026quot; create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:#weblogicDomainStoragePath\\: /scratch/k8s_dir:weblogicDomainStoragePath\\: /scratch/k8s_dir:g\u0026quot; create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml c. Run the create-pv-pvc.sh script to create the PV and PVC configuration files:\n$ ./create-pv-pvc.sh -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml -o output d. Create the PV and PVC using the configuration files created in the previous step:\n$ kubectl create -f output/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f output/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pvc.yaml   Install and configure the database for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nThis step is required only when a standalone database is not already set up and you want to use the database in a container.\nThe Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1). For production, it is suggested to use a standalone database. This example provides steps to create the database in a container.\n a. Create a database in a container:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service $ ./start-db-service.sh -i container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim -p none Once the database is successfully created, you can use the database connection string oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s as an rcuDatabaseURL parameter in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file.\nb. Create Oracle SOA Suite schemas for the domain type (for example, soaessosb).\nTo install the Oracle SOA Suite schemas, run the create-rcu-schema.sh script with the following inputs:\n -s \u0026lt;RCU PREFIX\u0026gt; Here: SOA1 -t \u0026lt;SOA domain type\u0026gt; Here: soaessosb -i \u0026lt;SOASuite image\u0026gt; Here: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh \\ -s SOA1 \\ -t soaessosb \\ -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4 \\ -q Oradoc_db1 \\ -r Oradoc_db1   Now the environment is ready to start the Oracle SOA Suite domain creation.\n6.2 Create an Oracle SOA Suite domain   The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at \u0026lt;weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project\u0026gt;/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain. You must edit create-domain-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain.\nUpdate create-domain-inputs.yaml with the following values for domain creation:\n domainType: soaessosb initialManagedServerReplicas: 1  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/ $ cp create-domain-inputs.yaml create-domain-inputs.yaml.orig $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:domainType\\: soa:domainType\\: soaessosb:g\u0026quot; create-domain-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:initialManagedServerReplicas\\: 2:initialManagedServerReplicas\\: 1:g\u0026quot; create-domain-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026quot;s:image\\: soasuite\\:12.2.1.4:image\\: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite\\:12.2.1.4:g\u0026quot; create-domain-inputs.yaml   Run the create-domain.sh script to create a domain:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/ $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output   Create a Kubernetes domain object:\nOnce the create-domain.sh is successful, it generates the output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml that you can use to create the Kubernetes resource domain, which starts the domain and servers:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ kubectl create -f output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml   Verify that the Kubernetes domain object named soainfra is created:\n$ kubectl get domain -n soans NAME AGE soainfra 3m18s   Once you create the domain, introspect pod is created. This inspects the domain home and then starts the soainfra-adminserver pod. Once the soainfra-adminserver pod starts successfully, then the Managed Server pods are started in parallel. Watch the soans namespace for the status of domain creation:\n$ kubectl get pods -n soans -w   Verify that the Oracle SOA Suite domain server pods and services are created and in Ready state:\n$ kubectl get all -n soans   6.3 Configure Traefik to access in Oracle SOA Suite domain services   Configure Traefik to manage ingresses created in the Oracle SOA Suite domain namespace (soans):\n$ helm upgrade traefik traefik/traefik \\ --reuse-values \\ --namespace traefik \\ --set \u0026quot;kubernetes.namespaces={traefik,soans}\u0026quot; \\ --wait   Create an ingress for the domain in the domain namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator $ helm install soa-traefik-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\ --namespace soans \\ --values kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml \\ --set \u0026quot;traefik.hostname=$(hostname -f)\u0026quot; \\ --set domainType=soaessosb   Verify the created ingress per domain details:\n$ kubectl describe ingress soainfra-traefik -n soans   6.4 Verify that you can access the Oracle SOA Suite domain URL   Get the LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME for your environment:\nexport LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME=$(hostname -f)   The following URLs are available for Oracle SOA Suite domains of domain type soaessosb:\nCredentials: username: weblogic password: Welcome1\nhttp://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/console http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/em http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/servicebus http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/soa-infra http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/soa/composer http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/integration/worklistapp http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/ess http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/EssHealthCheck   "

To deploy an Oracle SOA Suite domain, you must set up the deployment scripts.\n  Create a working directory to set up the source code:\n$ export WORKDIR=$HOME/soa_20.3.3 $ mkdir ${WORKDIR}   Download the supported version of the WebLogic Kubernetes operator source code from the operator github project. Currently the supported operator version is 3.0.1:\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git --branch release/3.0.1   Download the Oracle SOA Suite Kubernetes deployment scripts from the SOA repository and copy them to the WebLogic Kubernetes operator samples location:\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/20.3.3 $ mv -f ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain_backup $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/create-soa-domain ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/ $ mv -f ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/common ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/common_backup $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/common ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/ $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/create-database ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/ $ mv -f ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema_backup $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/create-rcu-schema ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/ $ mv -f ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain_backup $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/ingress-per-domain ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/charts/ $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/imagetool-scripts ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/ $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes/charts ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/   You can now use the deployment scripts from ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/ to set up the Oracle SOA Suite domains.\nObtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image The Oracle SOA Suite image with latest bundle patch and required interim patches can be obtained from My Oracle Support (MOS). This is the only image supported for production deployments. Follow the below steps to download the Oracle SOA Suite image from My Oracle Support.\n  Download the patch 31966923 from My Oracle Support (MOS).\n  Unzip the downloaded patch zip file.\n  Load the image archive using docker load command:\nFor example:\n$ docker load \u0026lt; soasuite.12214.tar Loaded image: soasuite:12.2.1.4 $   If you want to build and use an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with any additional bundle patch or interim patches those are not part of the image obtained from My Oracle Support, then follow these steps to create the image.\n Note: The default Oracle SOA Suite image name used for Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment is soasuite:12.2.1.4. The image obtained must be tagged as soasuite:12.2.1.4 using the docker tag command. If you want to use a different name for the image, make sure to update the new image tag name in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file and also in other instances where the soasuite:12.2.1.4 image name is used.\n Install the WebLogic Kubernetes operator The WebLogic Kubernetes operator supports the deployment of Oracle SOA Suite domains in the Kubernetes environment. Follow the steps in this document to install the operator.\n Note: Optionally, you can execute these steps to send the contents of the operator’s logs to Elasticsearch.\n In the following example commands to install the WebLogic Kubernetes operator, opns is the namespace and op-sa is the service account created for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns $ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator --namespace opns --set image=oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.0.1 --set serviceAccount=op-sa --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={}\u0026quot; --set \u0026quot;javaLoggingLevel=FINE\u0026quot; --wait Prepare the environment for Oracle SOA Suite domains Create a namespace for an Oracle SOA Suite domain Create a Kubernetes namespace (for example, soans) for the domain unless you intend to use the default namespace. Use the new namespace in the remaining steps in this section. For details, see Prepare to run a domain.\n $ kubectl create namespace soans $ helm upgrade --reuse-values --namespace opns --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={soans}\u0026quot; --wait weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator Create a persistent storage for an Oracle SOA Suite domain In the Kubernetes namespace you created, create the PV and PVC for the domain by running the create-pv-pvc.sh script. Follow the instructions for using the script to create a dedicated PV and PVC for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\n  Review the configuration parameters for PV creation here. Based on your requirements, update the values in the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file located at ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc/. Sample configuration parameter values for an Oracle SOA Suite domain are:\n baseName: domain domainUID: soainfra namespace: soans weblogicDomainStorageType: HOST_PATH weblogicDomainStoragePath: /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA    Ensure that the path for the weblogicDomainStoragePath property exists (if not, you need to create it), has full access permissions, and that the folder is empty.\n  Run the create-pv-pvc.sh script:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ ./create-pv-pvc.sh -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml -o output_soainfra   The create-pv-pvc.sh script will create a subdirectory pv-pvcs under the given /path/to/output-directory directory and creates two YAML configuration files for PV and PVC. Apply these two YAML files to create the PV and PVC Kubernetes resources using the kubectl create -f command:\n$ kubectl create -f output_soainfra/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f output_soainfra/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pvc.yaml   Create a Kubernetes secret with domain credentials Create the Kubernetes secrets username and password of the administrative account in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n $ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p Welcome1 -n soans -d soainfra -s soainfra-domain-credentials For more details, see this document.\nYou can check the secret with the kubectl get secret command.\nFor example:\n  Click here to see the sample secret description.   $ kubectl get secret soainfra-domain-credentials -o yaml -n soans apiVersion: v1 data: password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_username: c3lz username: U09BMQ== kind: Secret metadata: creationTimestamp: \u0026quot;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026quot; labels: weblogic.domainName: soainfra weblogic.domainUID: soainfra managedFields: - apiVersion: v1 fieldsType: FieldsV1 fieldsV1: f:data: .: {} f:password: {} f:sys_password: {} f:sys_username: {} f:username: {} f:metadata: f:labels: .: {} f:weblogic.domainName: {} f:weblogic.domainUID: {} f:type: {} manager: kubectl operation: Update time: \u0026quot;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026quot; name: soainfra-rcu-credentials namespace: soans resourceVersion: \u0026quot;265386\u0026quot; selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-rcu-credentials uid: 2d93941c-656b-43a4-8af2-78ca8be0f293 type: Opaque    Create a Kubernetes secret with the RCU credentials You also need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials for the database schemas.

The Repository Creation Utility (RCU) allows you to create those schemas. You must set up the database before you create your domain. There are no additional requirements added by running Oracle SOA Suite in Kubernetes; the same existing requirements apply.\nFor production deployments, you must set up and use the standalone (non-container) based database running outside of Kubernetes.\nBefore creating a domain, you will need to set up the necessary schemas in your database.\nRun the Repository Creation Utility to set up your database schemas Create schemas To create the database schemas for Oracle SOA Suite, run the create-rcu-schema.sh script.\nFor example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh -h usage: ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s \u0026lt;schemaPrefix\u0026gt; -t \u0026lt;schemaType\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;dburl\u0026gt; -i \u0026lt;image\u0026gt; -u \u0026lt;imagePullPolicy\u0026gt; -p \u0026lt;docker-store\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; -q \u0026lt;sysPassword\u0026gt; -r \u0026lt;schemaPassword\u0026gt; -o \u0026lt;rcuOutputDir\u0026gt; -l \u0026lt;schemaProfileType\u0026gt; [-h] -s RCU Schema Prefix (required) -t RCU Schema Type (optional) (supported values: fmw(default), soa, osb, soaosb, soaess, soaessosb) -d RCU Oracle Database URL (optional) (default: oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s) -p FMW Infrastructure ImagePullSecret (optional) (default: none) -i FMW Infrastructure Image (optional) (default: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4) -u FMW Infrastructure ImagePullPolicy (optional) (default: IfNotPresent) -n Namespace for RCU pod (optional) (default: default) -q password for database SYSDBA user.

You must specify one of these using the -t flag. Optionally, you can specify the Oracle SOA schema profile type using the -l flag. Supported values are SMALL, MED, and LARGE.   Note: To use the LARGE schema profile type, make sure that the partitioning feature is enabled in the Oracle Database.\n Make sure that you maintain the association between the database schemas and the matching domain just like you did in a non-Kubernetes environment. There is no specific functionality provided to help with this.\nDrop schemas If you want to drop a schema, you can use the drop-rcu-schema.sh script.\nFor example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema $ ./drop-rcu-schema.sh -h usage: ./drop-rcu-schema.sh -s \u0026lt;schemaPrefix\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;dburl\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; -q \u0026lt;sysPassword\u0026gt; -r \u0026lt;schemaPassword\u0026gt; -l \u0026lt;schemaProfileType\u0026gt; [-h] -s RCU Schema Prefix (required) -t RCU Schema Type (optional) (supported values: fmw(default), soa, osb, soaosb, soaess, soaessosb) -d Oracle Database URL (optional) (default: oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s) -n Namespace where RCU pod is deployed (optional) (default: default) -q password for database SYSDBA user.

You must specify one of these using the -t flag. Optionally, you can specify the Oracle SOA schema profile type using the -l flag. Supported values are SMALL, MED, and LARGE.  Create an Oracle SOA Suite domain Now that you have your Docker images and you have created your RCU schemas, you are ready to create your domain. To continue, follow the instructions in Create Oracle SOA Suite domains.\n"

	"content": "Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides a secured communication for data sent over unsecured networks. In an SSL termination scenario, you can configure SSL between the client browser and the load balancer in your Oracle SOA Suite instance to ensure that applications are accessed securely. In an SSL end-to-end scenario, an Oracle SOA Suite domain is configured to use a self-signed SSL certificate that was generated during domain creation. Clients will typically receive a message indicating that the signing CA for the certificate is unknown and not trusted.\nThis section provides details on how to create and configure custom (CA-issued) SSL certificates for Oracle SOA Suite domains in both SSL end-to-end and SSL termination scenarios.\n Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL end-to-end scenario Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL termination at a load balancer  Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL end-to-end scenario These steps describe how to replace the identity and trust keystore of an Oracle SOA Suite domain with a custom identity and custom trust keystore and register with digital certificates procured from any third party authority.\nIn this documentation, the registered domain is mydomain.com and the CA signed certificates are taken from mydomain.\nCreate a custom identity and custom trust keystore and generate a certificate signing request (CSR) To create a custom identity and custom trust keystore and generate a CSR:\n  Log in to the Enterprise Manager (EM) Console and access the Keystores page by opening WebLogic Domain \u0026gt; Security \u0026gt; Keystore.\n  Under the system stripe, click Create Keystore to create a new keystore.\n  Provide the following details for custom identity:\nKeystore Name: custIdentity Protection: Select the Password option. Keystore Password: Enter the password. Confirm Password: Confirm the password.\n  Click Create Keystore to create another new keystore.\n  Provide the following details for custom trust:\n Keystore Name: custTrust Protection: Select the Password option. Keystore Password: Enter the password. Confirm Password: Confirm the password.    Click Manage on the custIdentity keystore name and provide the password that you specified previously.\n  Click Generate Keypair to create a new key pair, and provide the following details for custIdentity with alias as custIdentity and password:\n Alias Name: custIdentity Common Name: Common name, for example, soak8s.mydomain.com (Registered domain name) Organizational Unit: Name of the organizational unit Organization: Organization name Enter City, State, and Country names Key Type: RSA Key Size: 2048 Password: Enter the password    Click OK to generate the keypair.\n  Select the newly created keypair and click Generate CSR.\n  Export the created CSR, share it with Certificate Authority, such as digicert CA, and get root, intermediate, and signed certificates. The certificate is generated for the domain name you used in the Common Name field.\n  It is not mandatory to create identity and trust keystore under the system stripe that comes with default provisioning. You can create a new custom stripe and create identity and trust keystores under it.\nShare the CSR with CA to get CA-signed certificates   Select the new keypair under the custIdentity and click Generate CSR.\n  Export the created CSR and share it with the Certificate Authority and get root, intermediate, and signed certificates. The certificate is generated for the domain name you used in the Common Name field.\n  Download the certificates shared in the zip file from the CA. The zip file contains one of the following:\n the three certificates individually - root, intermediate, and signed certificates root and intermediate certificates in one chain and signed certificate separately    Double-click the certificate chain for root and intermediate certificates. You can see the full chain when you click on the certification path.\n  Extract the root and intermediate certificates individually by going to the certification path, select the certificate to be extracted (root or intermediate) and click View Certificate.\n  On the View Certificates pop-up, select the Details tab and click Copy to File.\n  In the Certificate Export wizard, click Next, then select Base 64 encoded X.509 (CER), and then click Next. Export the certificate.\n  Name the exported certificate as root and intermediate certificates respectively.\n  Import CA certificates Certificate Authority (CA) certificates must be imported in the following order: first the signed server certificate, then the intermediate certificate, and then the root certificate.\nTo import CA certificates:\n  Use WLST commands to import the certificate chain in the identity keystore (custIdentity):\na. Combine the three certificates into a single text file called chain.pem in the following order: signed server certificate, followed by intermediate certificate, followed by root certificate:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;signed server certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;intermediate certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;root certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- b.

Enter the following command to change the file ownership to 1000:1000 user/group:\n$ sudo chown 1000:1000 /tmp/chain.pem d. Copy /tmp/chain.pem into the Administration Server pod (for example, soainfra-adminserver):\n$ kubectl cp /tmp/chain.pem soans/soainfra-adminserver:/tmp/chain.pem e.

Click Save and Activate changes.\n  Repeat steps 1 to 7 for all Managed Servers.\n  Restart the domain.\n  Once the servers are up and running, you can check if the SSL URLs show the updated certificates.\n  For more details, refer to:\n Administering Oracle SOA Cloud Service Administering Oracle Fusion Middleware  Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL termination at a load balancer This section provides references to configure a custom SSL certificate at a load balancer.\nThere are multiple CA vendors in the marketplace today, each offering different levels of service at varying price points. Research and choose a CA vendor that meets your service-level and budget requirements.\nFor a CA vendor to issue you a CA-issued SSL certificate, you must provide the following information:\n Your custom domain name. Public information associated with the domain confirming you as the owner. Email address associated with the custom domain for verification.  Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for your load balancer and submit the CSR to the CA vendor. After receiving the CA-issued certificate, refer to Administering Oracle SOA Cloud Service to import the CA-issued SSL certificate to the load balancer. If you are using openssl to create the certificates, you can refer to Manually Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Using OpenSSL to submit the CSR to the CA vendor.\n"

The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, complete the following steps:\n Review the Domain resource documentation. Review the requirements and limitations. Ensure that you have executed all the preliminary steps in Prepare your environment. Ensure that the database and the WebLogic Kubernetes operator are running.  Prepare to use the create domain script The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain.\nYou must edit create-domain-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain. Refer to the configuration parameters below to understand the information that you must provide in this file.\nConfiguration parameters The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     sslEnabled Boolean indicating whether to enable SSL for each WebLogic Server instance. false   adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminServerSSLPort SSL port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7002   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is soa_cluster for the SOA domain type.

By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the SOA domain.

This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. soainfra   domainType Type of the domain. Mandatory input for Oracle SOA Suite domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type values: soa (deploys a SOA domain),osb (deploys an OSB (Oracle Service Bus) domain),soaess (deploys a SOA domain with Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)),soaosb (deploys a domain with SOA and OSB), and soaessosb (deploys a domain with SOA, OSB, and ESS). soa   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. false   httpAccessLogInLogHome Boolean indicating if server HTTP access log files should be written to the same directory as logHome. Otherwise, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory specified in the WebLogic domain home configuration. true   image SOA Suite Docker image. The operator requires Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4. Refer to Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image for details on how to obtain or create the image. soasuite:12.2.1.4   imagePullPolicy WebLogic Docker image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never. IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). If sslEnabled is set to true and the WebLogic demo certificate is used, add -Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true to allow the managed servers to connect to the Administration Server while booting up. The WebLogic generated demo certificate in this environment typically contains a host name that is different from the runtime container\u0026rsquo;s host name. -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/soainfra   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. By default the managedServerNameBase is soa_server for the SOA domain type. You can update this to osb_server for an OSB domain type or soa_server for SOAESS or SOAOSB or SOAESSOSB domain types. soa_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. By default the managedServerPort is 8001 for the SOA domain type. You can update this to 9001 for an OSB domain type or 8001 for SOAESS or SOAOSB or SOAESSOSB domain types. 8001   managedServerSSLPort SSL port number for each Managed Server. By default the managedServerSSLPort is 8002 for the SOA domain type. You can update this to 9002 for an OSB domain type or 8002 for SOAESS or SOAOSB or SOAESSOSB domain types. 8002   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. soans   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. soainfra-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are NEVER, IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY. IF_NEEDED   t3ChannelPort Port for the t3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. soainfra-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example SOA1. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. SOA1   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. soainfra-rcu-credentials   persistentStore The persistent store for \u0026lsquo;JMS servers\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Transaction log store\u0026rsquo; in the domain. Legal values are jdbc, file. jdbc    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an Oracle SOA Suite domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ ./create-domain.sh \\ -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \\ -o \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; The script will perform the following steps:\n  Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist. The path name is \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before using this script.\n  Create a Kubernetes job that will start up a utility Oracle SOA Suite container and run offline WLST scripts to create the domain on the shared storage.\n  Run and wait for the job to finish.\n  Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, domain.yaml, in the \u0026ldquo;output\u0026rdquo; directory that was created above. This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the kubectl create -f or kubectl apply -f command:\n$ kubectl apply -f \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/domain.yaml   Create a convenient utility script, delete-domain-job.yaml, to clean up the domain home created by the create script.\n  The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001. A configured cluster named soa_cluster of size 5. Two Managed Servers, named soa_server1 and soa_server2, listening on port 8001. Log files that are located in /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. SOA Infra, SOA composer and WorklistApp applications deployed.  Verify the results The create domain script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error. However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.\nGenerated YAML files with the default inputs   Click here to see sample content of the generated `domain.yaml` for `soaessosb` domainType that creates SOA and OSB clusters.   $ cat output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml # Copyright (c) 2017, 2020, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates. # Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl. # # This is an example of how to define a Domain resource. # apiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v8\u0026quot;

Make sure your environment meets all prerequisites. Make sure the database used for the SOA domain deployment is up and running during the upgrade process.  Upgrade the Kubernetes version An upgrade of Kubernetes is supported from one MINOR version to the next MINOR version, or between PATCH versions of the same MINOR. For example, you can upgrade from 1.x to 1.x+1, but not from 1.x to 1.x+2. To upgrade a Kubernetes version, first all the master nodes of the Kubernetes cluster must be upgraded sequentially, followed by the sequential upgrade of each worker node.\n See here for Kubernetes official documentation to upgrade from v1.14.x to v1.15.x.

Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it. In these steps, this directory is imagetool-setup.\n$ mkdir imagetool-setup $ cd imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file to the imagetool-setup directory.\n  Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool on a Linux environment:\n$ cd imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git   Copy the additional WebLogic Image Tool build files from the operator source repository to the imagetool-setup location:\n$ mkdir -p imagetool-setup/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0 $ cd imagetool-setup/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0 $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/imagetool-scripts/* .   Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool and required build scripts, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle SOA Suite Docker image.\nDownload the Oracle SOA Suite installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle SOA Suite installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice. In these steps, this directory is download location.\n  Click here to see the sample list of installation binaries and patches:     JDK:\n jdk-8u241-linux-x64.tar.gz    Fusion MiddleWare Infrastructure installer:\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_infrastructure.jar    Fusion MiddleWare Infrastructure patches:\n p28186730_139422_Generic.zip (Opatch) p30432881_122140_Generic.zip (OWSM) p30513324_122140_Linux-x86-64.zip (OSS) p30581253_122140_Generic.zip (ADF) p30689820_122140_Generic.zip (WLS) p30729380_122140_Generic.zip (COH)    SOA and OSB installers:\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_soa.jar fmw_12.2.1.4.0_osb.jar    SOA and OSB patches:\n p30749990_122140_Generic.zip (SOA) p30779352_122140_Generic.zip (OSB)       Note: This is a sample list of patches. You must get the appropriate list of patches for your Oracle SOA Suite image.\n Update required build files The following files available in the code repository location ${WORKDIR}/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/imagetool-scripts are used for creating the image.\n additionalBuildCmds.txt buildArgs    In the buildArgs file, update all the occurrences of %DOCKER_REPO% with the docker-images repository location, which is the complete path of imagetool-setup/docker-images.\nFor example, update:\n%DOCKER_REPO%/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0/\nto:\n\u0026lt;imagetool-setup-location\u0026gt;/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0/\n  Similarly, update the placeholders %JDK_VERSION% and %BUILDTAG% with appropriate values.\n  Create the image   Add a JDK package to the WebLogic Image Tool cache:\n$ imagetool cache addInstaller --type jdk --version 8u241 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/jdk-8u241-linux-x64.tar.gz   Add the downloaded installation binaries to the WebLogic Image Tool cache:\n$ imagetool cache addInstaller --type fmw --version 12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/fmw_12.2.1.4.0_infrastructure.jar $ imagetool cache addInstaller --type soa --version 12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/fmw_12.2.1.4.0_soa.jar $ imagetool cache addInstaller --type osb --version 12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/fmw_12.2.1.4.0_osb.jar   Add the downloaded patches to the WebLogic Image Tool cache:\n  Click here to see the commands to add patches in to the cache:   ``` bash $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 28186730_13.9.4.2.2 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p28186730_139422_Generic.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30432881_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30432881_122140_Generic.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30513324_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30513324_122140_Linux-x86-64.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30581253_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30581253_122140_Generic.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30689820_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30689820_122140_Generic.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30729380_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30729380_122140_Generic.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30749990_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30749990_122140_Generic.zip $ imagetool cache addEntry --key 30779352_12.2.1.4.0 --path \u0026lt;download location\u0026gt;/p30779352_122140_Generic.zip ```      Update the patches list to buildArgs.\nTo the create command in the buildArgs file, append the Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus patches list using the --patches flag and Opatch patch using the --opatchBugNumber flag.

Consult the README file for important prerequisite steps, such as building or pulling the Server JRE Docker image, Oracle FMW Infrastructure Docker image, and downloading the Oracle SOA Suite installer and bundle patch binaries.\nA prebuilt Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4, is available at container-registry.oracle.com. We recommend that you pull and rename this image to build the Oracle SOA Suite image.\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 $ docker tag container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 Follow these steps to build an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, and then the Oracle SOA Suite image as a layer on top of that:\n  Make a local clone of the sample repository:\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images   Build the oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 image:\n$ cd docker-images/OracleFMWInfrastructure/dockerfiles $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4 -s This will produce an image named oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.\n  Download the Oracle SOA Suite installer from the Oracle Technology Network or e-delivery.\n Note: Copy the installer binaries to the same location as the Dockerfile.\n   To build the Oracle SOA Suite image with patches, you must download and drop the patch zip files (for example, p29928100_122140_Generic.zip) into the patches/ folder under the version that is required. For example, for 12.2.1.4.0 the folder is 12.2.1.4/patches.\n  Create the Oracle SOA Suite image by running the provided script:\n$ cd docker-images/OracleSOASuite/dockerfiles $ ./buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4 -s The image produced will be named oracle/soa:12.2.1.4. The samples and instructions assume the Oracle SOA Suite image is named soasuite:12.2.1.4. You must rename your image to match this name, or update the samples to refer to the image you created.\n$ docker tag oracle/soa:12.2.1.4 soasuite:12.2.1.4   "

	"description": "This section describes known issues for Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment on Kubernetes. Also, provides answers to frequently asked questions.",
	"content": "Overriding tuning parameters is not supported using configuration overrides The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes operator enables you to override some of the domain configuration using configuration overrides (also called situational configuration). See supported overrides. Overriding the tuning parameters such as MaxMessageSize and PAYLOAD, for Oracle SOA Suite domains is not supported using the configuration overrides feature. However, you can override them using the following steps:\n  Specify the new value using the environment variable K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES in serverPod.env section in domain.yaml configuration file (example path: \u0026lt;domain-creation-output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml) based on the servers to which the changes are to be applied.\nFor example, to override the value at the Administration Server pod level:\nspec: adminServer: serverPod: env: - name: K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES value: \u0026#34;-Dweblogic.MaxMessageSize=78787878\u0026#34; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms512m -Xmx1024m \u0026#39; serverStartState: RUNNING For example, to override the value at a specific cluster level (soa_cluster or osb_cluster):\n- clusterName: soa_cluster serverService: precreateService: true serverStartState: \u0026#34;RUNNING\u0026#34; serverPod: env: - name: K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES value: \u0026#34;-Dsoa.payload.threshold.kb=102410\u0026#34;  Note: When multiple system properties are specified for serverPod.env.value, make sure each system property is separated by a space.\n   Apply the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: The server pod(s) will be automatically restarted (rolling restart).\n   Deployments in the WebLogic Server Administration Console may display unexpected error In an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using the operator, accessing Deployments from the WebLogic Server Administration Console home page may display the error message Unexpected error encountered while obtaining monitoring information for applications. This error does not have any functional impact and can be ignored. You can verify that the applications are in Active state from the Control tab in Summary of deployments page.\nEnterprise Manager Console may display ADF_FACES-30200 error In an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using the operator, the Enterprise Manager Console may intermittently display the following error when the domain servers are restarted:\nADF_FACES-30200: For more information, please see the server\u0026#39;s error log for an entry beginning with: The UIViewRoot is null. Fatal exception during PhaseId: RESTORE_VIEW 1. You can refresh the Enterprise Manager Console URL to successfully log in to the Console.\nConfigure the external URL access for Oracle SOA Suite composite applications For Oracle SOA Suite composite applications to access the external URLs over the internet (if your cluster is behind a http proxy server), you must configure the following proxy parameters for Administration Server and Managed Server pods.\n-Dhttp.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttps.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\u0026#34;localhost|soainfra-adminserver|soainfra-soa-server1|soainfra-osb-server1|...soainfra-soa-serverN|*.svc.cluster.local|*.your.domain.com|/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; To do this, edit the domain.yaml configuration file and append the proxy parameters to the spec.serverPod.env.JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable value.\nFor example:\nserverPod: env: - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false -Dweblogic.ssl.Enabled=true -Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true -Dhttp.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttps.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\u0026#34;localhost|soainfra-adminserver|soainfra-soa-server1|soainfra-osb-server1|...soainfra-soa-serverN|*.svc.cluster.local|*.your.domain.com|/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms256m -Xmx1024m \u0026#39; volumeMounts:  Note: The -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts parameter must have the pod names of the Administration Server and each Managed Server. For example: soainfra-adminserver, soainfra-soa-server1, soainfra-osb-server1, and so on.\n Apply the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: The server pod(s) will be automatically restarted (rolling restart).\n Configure the external access for the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler WebServices WSDL URLs In an Oracle SOA Suite domain deployed including the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS) component, the following ESS WebServices WSDL URLs shown in the table format in the ess/essWebServicesWsdl.jsp page are not reachable outside the Kubernetes cluster.\nESSWebService EssAsyncCallbackService EssWsJobAsyncCallbackService Follow these steps to configure the external access for the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler WebServices WSDL URLs:\n Log in to the Administration Console URL of the domain.\nFor example: http://\u0026lt;LOADBALANCER-HOST\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/console In the Home Page, click Clusters. Then click the soa_cluster. Click the HTTP tab and then click Lock \u0026amp; Edit in the Change Center panel. Update the following values:  Frontend Host: host name of the load balancer. For example, domain1.example.com. Frontend HTTP Port: load balancer port. For example, 30305. Frontend HTTPS Port: load balancer https port. For example, 30443.   Click Save.
