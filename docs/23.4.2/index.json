	"description": "Topology for Oracle SOA Suite Enterprise Deployment on Kubernetes.",
	"content": "Assumptions The most relevant assumptions for the Oracle SOA Suite Kubernetes Enterprise Deployment Guide (EDG) topology are related to the database and web tiers. Typical on-premises production systems keep their high end database (such as RAC, RAC+DG, Exadata, Autonomous Database) out of the Kubernetes cluster and manage that tier separately. This implies that the database runs separately from the Kubernetes cluster hosting the application tier. The database provisioning and configuration process is out of the scope of the Oracle SOA Suite Kubernetes setup. Typically, it is administered and maintained by different teams and the Oracle SOA Suite Enterprise Deployment Guide would need to consume just the scan address and database service to be used for the RCU and data source creation. Similarly, the demilitarized zone (DMZ) will likely remain untouched: Customer investments in load balancers (LBRs) are well consolidated, and the security and DMZ policies are well established. Using an HTTP proxy in the DMZ has become a standard. Additionally, Single Sign On (such as OAM and others) may remain for some time and those are best addressed in the web tier than as part of the Kubernetes cluster.\nDue to total cost of ownership reasons, the Kubernetes control plane uses a stacked etcd. External etcd is also possible but, given RAFT protocol\u0026rsquo;s reliability, this option requires a significant amount of additional setup work and three additional nodes just to host the etcd system.\nTopology Diagram Tier Description Control Plane The control plane consists of three nodes where the Kubernetes API server is deployed, front-ended by a load balancer (LBR). The LBR exposes the required virtual IP address (VIP) and virtual server (VS) for both the Oracle SOA Suite and the control plane itself (although an internal-only VS can also be used). This URL must be site or data center agnostic in preparation for disaster protection. The control plane and worker nodes must be able to resolve this hostname name properly AND SHOULD NOT USE IPs for it. As explained in the assumptions section, the etcd tier is stacked with the kube-api servers. Each control plane node runs Kubernetes kube-api, kube-controller, kube-scheduler, and etcd instances pointing to local etcd mounts. The etcd has been tested by the Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) team on DBFS, NFS, and local file systems. No significant performance differences were observed between the two options for an Oracle SOA Suite system. However, this decision may require additional analysis in each customer case depending on the usage by other apps in the same cluster. Using etcd directly on DBFS allows shipping etcd directly to secondary data centers and allows flashing back quickly to previous versions of the control plane using DB technology. However, it creates a dependency between etcd and the database that is discouraged. The etcd snapshots CAN, however, be placed on DBFS to simplify the continuous shipping of copies to secondary regions and leaving it to Data Guard. These are the options that will be applicable or not depending on the customer needs:\n Place etcd on root or local volumes, ship snapshots with regular rsyncs over reliable networks. Place etcd on NFS, ship snapshots with regular rsyncs over reliable networks. Place etcd on NFS or local volume, copy snapshots to DBFS for shipping to secondary. Application tier.  Application Tier Oracle SOA Suite internal applications and custom deployments on SOA (composites) and WebLogic (ears, jars, wars) are run on three worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. The typical allocation on Kubernetes places the WebLogic Administration Server on the first node and each of the servers in the Oracle SOA Suite and/or Service Bus clusters in the other two. This can vary depending on the workloads and kube controller and scheduler decisions.\n$ kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep soa soans soaedgdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 19h 10.244.3.127 olk8-w1 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; soans soaedgdomain-create-soa-infra-domain-job-6pq9z 0/1 Completed 0 67d 10.244.4.2 olk8-w2 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; soans soaedgdomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 22h 10.244.5.161 olk8-w3 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; soans soaedgdomain-soa-server2 1/1 Running 0 22h 10.244.4.178 olk8-w2 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; The application tier is critically dependent on the Kubernetes DNS pods to be able to resolve the scan address for the RAC database.\nA dual configuration for persistent volumes is used to avoid a single point of failure in the Oracle SOA Suite domain configuration. Two separate NFS devices are used for high availability. Refer to the Configure redundant persistent volume for details.\nThe internal Oracle SOA Suite and Service Bus clusters use some of the configuration best practices prescribed for on-premises systems. Refer to the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite 12c (12.2.1.4):\n  Automatic Service Migration is used for the Java Message Service (JMS) and Java Transaction API (JTA) Services.\n  All the persistent stores are JDBC persistent stores.\n  Node manager is used to monitor the managed server\u0026rsquo;s health.\n  There are significant differences with an on-premises enterprise deployment. The most relevant are:\n  WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is used to manage the lifecycle of the managed servers, instead of the WebLogic Administration Console or WLST.\n  Scale out procedures are based on the Kubernetes cluster.\n  The WebLogic Administration Server does NOT use its own/separate WebLogic domain directory.\n  Listen addresses and hostnames are \u0026ldquo;virtual\u0026rdquo; out-of-the-box, which provides a significant advantage when considering disaster protection.\n  The OHS/DMZ tier routes to the back-end WebLogic clusters and Administration Server, using a precise node port available in the different nodes.\n  External subsystems: LBR, OHS, and Database Oracle SOA Suite interacts with the following external artifacts: front-end LBR, OHS/DMZ-proxy, Database, and external authenticators.\n  The LBR is used both to route to kube-api and as a standard Oracle SOA Suite front end.\n  The front-end LBR Oracle SOA Suite configuration is identical to an on-premises system. For more information, see the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite 12c 12.2.1.4.\n  For kube-api access, the LBR uses a layer4 (TCP) listener. This listener forwards to the backend control plane nodes. Note: Use hostnames and avoid IP address.\n  The Database tier consists of a RAC Database that hosts JMS/JTA persistent stores, OPSS, and MDS information. The setup of this RAC database is out of the scope of these procedures. All the standard MAA best practices for database services, processes, and DB configuration for a SOA cluster are applicable on Kubernetes. For more details, see the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite 12c 12.2.1.4.\n  External auth providers can be used as described in the Oracle SOA Suite EDG procedures.\n  Single Sign-On through OHS with OAM is possible, as in a standard on-premises Oracle SOA Suite deployment.\n  OHS routes to precise node ports for the SOA Cluster, OSB Cluster, and Administration Server. This is based on the fact that Oracle SOA Suite exposes very few services, which do not change much through the system\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle. This also avoids overhead and dependencies on ingress and additional third party controllers. The OHS configuration is similar to a standard on-premises configuration, except that it disables the Dynamic Server list and uses the list of worker nodes with the precise node port for each cluster.\n  "

	"content": "This section provides information about the system requirements, limitations, licensing, and pricing for deploying and running Oracle SOA Suite domains with the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nSystem requirements for Oracle SOA Suite domains Release 23.4.2 has the following system requirements:\n Kubernetes 1.24.0+, 1.25.0+, 1.26.2+, and 1.27.2+ (check with kubectl version). Docker 19.03.11+ (check with docker version) or CRI-O 1.20.2+ (check with crictl version | grep RuntimeVersion). Flannel networking v0.13.0-amd64 or later (check with docker images | grep flannel), Calico networking v3.16.1 or later. Helm 3.10.2+ (check with helm version --client --short). WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.1.4 (see the operator releases 4.1.4 pages). You must have the cluster-admin role to install the operator. The operator does not need the cluster-admin role at runtime. For more information, see the role-based access control (RBAC) documentation. We do not currently support running SOA in non-Linux containers. Container images based on Oracle Linux 8 are now supported. My Oracle Support and the Oracle Container Registry host container images based on both Oracle Linux 7 and 8. Additionally, see the Oracle SOA Suite documentation for other requirements, such as database version.  See here for resource sizing information for Oracle SOA Suite domains set up on a Kubernetes cluster.\nLimitations Compared to running a WebLogic Server domain in Kubernetes using the operator, the following limitations currently exist for Oracle SOA Suite domains:\n In this release, Oracle SOA Suite domains are supported using the domain on a persistent volume model only, where the domain home is located in a persistent volume (PV). The \u0026ldquo;domain in image\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;model in image\u0026rdquo; models are not supported. Also, \u0026ldquo;WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT)\u0026rdquo; based deployments are currently not supported. Only configured clusters are supported. Dynamic clusters are not supported for Oracle SOA Suite domains. Note that you can still use all of the scaling features, but you need to define the maximum size of your cluster at domain creation time. Mixed clusters (configured servers targeted to a dynamic cluster) are not supported. The WebLogic Logging Exporter project has been archived. Users are encouraged to use Fluentd or Logstash. The WebLogic Monitoring Exporter currently supports WebLogic MBean trees only. Support for JRF and Oracle SOA Suite MBeans is not available. Also, a metrics dashboard specific to Oracle SOA Suite is not available. Instead, use the WebLogic Server dashboard to monitor the Oracle SOA Suite server metrics in Grafana. Some features such as multicast, multitenancy, production redeployment, and Node Manager (although it is used internally for the liveness probe and to start WebLogic Server instances) are not supported in this release. Features such as Java Messaging Service whole server migration and consensus leasing are not supported in this release. Maximum availability architecture (Oracle SOA Suite EDG setup) is available for preview. Enabling or disabling the memory resiliency for Oracle Service Bus using the Enterprise Manager Console is not supported in this release. Zero downtime upgrade (ZDT) of the domain is not supported.  For up-to-date information about the features of WebLogic Server that are supported in Kubernetes environments, see My Oracle Support Doc ID 2349228.1.\nPricing and licensing The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and Oracle Linux are open source and free; WebLogic Server requires licenses in any environment. All WebLogic Server licenses are suitable for deploying WebLogic to containers and Kubernetes, including free single desktop Oracle Technology Network (OTN) developer licenses. See the following sections for more detailed information:\n Oracle SOA Suite Oracle Linux Oracle Java WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Oracle SOA Suite images Additional references  Oracle SOA Suite Oracle SOA Suite is licensed as an option to Oracle WebLogic Suite. Valid licenses are needed in at least one of the following combinations:\n WebLogic Suite and Oracle SOA Suite WebLogic Suite and Oracle Service Bus WebLogic Suite and Oracle BPEL Engine  For more information, see the Fusion Middleware Licensing Information User Manual - Oracle SOA Suite and the following sections.\nOracle Linux Oracle Linux is under open source license and is completely free to download and use.\nNote that Oracle SOA Suite licenses that include support do not include customer entitlements for direct access to Oracle Linux support or Unbreakable Linux Network (to directly access the standalone Oracle Linux patches). The latest Oracle Linux patches are included with the latest Oracle SOA Suite images.\nOracle Java Oracle support for Java is included with Oracle SOA Suite licenses when Java is used for running WebLogic and Coherence servers or clients.\nFor more information, see the Fusion Middleware Licensing Information User Manual.\nOracle SOA Suite images Oracle provides two different types of Oracle SOA Suite images:\n  Critical Patch Update (CPU) images: Images with the latest Oracle SOA Suite, Fusion Middleware Infrastructure, Coherence PSUs, and other fixes released by the Critical Patch Update (CPU) program. CPU images are intended for production use.\n  General Availability (GA) images: Images that are not intended for production use and do not include Oracle SOA Suite, WebLogic, Fusion Middleware Infrastructure, or Coherence PSUs.\n  All Oracle SOA Suite licenses, including free Oracle Technology Network (OTN) developer licenses, include access to the latest General Availability (GA) Oracle SOA Suite images, which bundle Java SE.\nCustomers with access to Oracle SOA Suite support additionally have:\n Access to Critical Patch Update (CPU) Oracle SOA Suite images, which bundle Java SE.

	"content": "Learn how to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper (running outside the Kubernetes network) to an Oracle SOA Suite instance in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment.\nUse JDeveloper for development and test environments only. For a production environment, you should deploy using Application Control and WLST methods.\n Deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications to Oracle SOA Suite from JDeveloper To deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper, the Administration Server must be configured to expose a T3 channel. The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator provides an option to expose a T3 channel for the Administration Server using the exposeAdminT3Channel setting during domain creation, then the matching T3 service can be used to connect. By default, when exposeAdminT3Channel is set, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment exposes the NodePort for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint at 30012 (use t3ChannelPort to configure the port to a different value).\nIf you miss enabling exposeAdminT3Channel during domain creation, follow Expose a T3/T3S Channel for the Administration Server to expose a T3 channel manually.\nPrerequisites   Get the Kubernetes cluster master address and verify the T3 port that will be used for creating application server connections. Use the following command to get the T3 port:\n$ kubectl get service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;AdministrationServerName\u0026gt;-external -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;-o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}' For example:\n$ kubectl get service soainfra-adminserver-external -n soans -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'   Oracle SOA Suite in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment is deployed in a Reference Configuration domain. If a SOA project is developed in Classic mode JDeveloper displays a Mismatch notification in the Deploy Composite Wizard. By default, JDeveloper is in Classic mode. To develop SOA projects in Reference Configuration mode, you must manually enable this feature in JDeveloper: a. From the File menu, select Tools, then Preferences. b. Select Reference Configuration Settings. c. Select Enable Reference Configuration settings in adapters.\n  JDeveloper needs to access the Servers during deployment. In the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment, Administration and Managed Servers are pods and cannot be accessed directly by JDeveloper. As a workaround, you must configure the reachability of the Managed Servers:\nThe Managed Server T3 port is not exposed by default and opening this will have a security risk as the authentication method here is based on a userid/password. It is not recommended to do this on production instances.\n   Decide on an external IP address to be used to configure access to the Managed Servers. Master or worker node IP address can be used to configure Managed Server reachability. In these steps, the Kubernetes cluster master IP is used for demonstration.\n  Get the pod names of the Administration Server and Managed Servers (that is, \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;server name\u0026gt;), which will be used to map in /etc/hosts.\n  Update /etc/hosts (or in Windows, C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts) on the host where JDeveloper is running with the entries below, where\n\u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Administration Server pod name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Managed Server1 pod name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Managed Server2 pod name\u0026gt; Sample /etc/hosts entries looks as follows, where X.X.X.X is the master node IP address:\nX.X.X.X soainfra-adminserver X.X.X.X soainfra-soa-server1 X.X.X.X soainfra-soa-server2   Get the Kubernetes service name of the Oracle SOA Suite cluster to access externally with the master IP (or external IP):\n$ kubectl get service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get service soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster -n soans   Create a Kubernetes service to expose the Oracle SOA Suite cluster service (\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt;) externally with same port as the Managed Server:\n$ kubectl expose service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt; --name \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt;-ext --external-ip=\u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl expose service soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster --name soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster-ext --external-ip=X.X.X.X -n soans  In a production environment, exposing the SOA cluster service with an external IP address is not recommended, as it can cause message drops on the SOA Managed Servers.\n     Create an application server connection in JDeveloper   Create a new application server connection (for example wls-k8s-op-connection) in JDeveloper:   In the configuration page, provide the WebLogic Hostname as the Kubernetes Master Address.\n  Update the Port as the T3 port (default is 30012) obtained in Prerequisites.\n  Enter the WebLogic Domain value (domainUID).\n  Test the connection to verify it is successful.   Deploy SOA composite applications using JDeveloper   In JDeveloper, right-click the SOA project you want to deploy and select Deploy to display the deployment wizard.   In the Deployment Action page, select Deploy to Application Server and click Next.   In the Deployment Configuration page, select the appropriate options and click Next.   In the Select server page, select the application server connection (wls-k8s-op-connection) that was created earlier and click Next.   If the Prerequisites were configured correctly, the lookup discovers the Managed Servers for deploying the composite.   Using the application server connection, the Managed Servers (Oracle SOA Suite cluster) are listed on the SOA Servers page. Select the Oracle SOA Suite cluster and click Next.   On the Summary page, click Finish to start deploying the composites to the Oracle SOA Suite cluster.   Verify logs on JDeveloper to confirm successful deployment.   Enter the soa-infra URLs in a browser to confirm the composites are deployed on both servers of the Oracle SOA Suite cluster.   Deploy Oracle Service Bus composite applications using JDeveloper   In JDeveloper, right-click the Oracle Service Bus project you want to deploy and select Deploy to display the deployment wizard.   In the Deployment Action page, select Deploy to Application Server and click Next.

	"content": "Oracle releases Oracle SOA Suite images regularly with the latest bundle and recommended interim patches in My Oracle Support (MOS). However, if you need to create images with new bundle and interim patches, you can build these images using the WebLogic Image Tool.\nIf you have access to the Oracle SOA Suite patches, you can patch an existing Oracle SOA Suite image with a bundle patch and interim patches. Oracle recommends that you use the WebLogic Image Tool to patch the Oracle SOA Suite image.\n Recommendations:\n Use the WebLogic Image Tool create feature for patching the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a bundle patch and multiple interim patches. This is the recommended approach because it optimizes the size of the image. Use the WebLogic Image Tool update feature for patching the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Apply the patched Oracle SOA Suite image To update an Oracle SOA Suite domain with a patched image, first make sure the patched image is pulled or created and available on the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Once the patched image is available, you can follow these steps to update the Oracle SOA Suite domain with a patched image:\n Stop all servers Update user permissions of the domain PV storage Address post-installation requirements Apply the patched image  Stop all servers  Note: The following steps are applicable only for non-Zero Downtime Patching. For Zero Downtime Patching, go to Address post-installation requirements.\n Before applying the patch, stop all servers in the domain:\n  In the domain.yaml configuration file, update the spec.serverStartPolicy field value to NEVER (for Operator 3.x) or Never (for Operator 4.x).\n  Shut down the domain (stop all servers) by applying the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml   Update user permissions of the domain PV storage The Oracle SOA Suite image for release 23.4.2 has an oracle user with UID 1000, with the default group set to root. Before applying the patched image, update the user permissions of the domain persistent volume (PV) to set the group to root:\n$ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA Address post-installation requirements If the patches in the patched Oracle SOA Suite image have any post-installation steps, follow these steps:\n Create a Kubernetes pod with domain home access Perform post-installation steps  Create a Kubernetes pod with domain home access   Get domain home persistence volume claim details for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nFor example, to list the persistent volume claim details in the namespace soans:\n$ kubectl get pvc -n soans Sample output showing the persistent volume claim is soainfra-domain-pvc:\nNAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE soainfra-domain-pvc Bound soainfra-domain-pv 10Gi RWX soainfra-domain-storage-class xxd   Create a YAML soapostinstall.yaml using the domain home persistence volume claim.\nFor example, using soainfra-domain-pvc per the sample output:\n Note: Replace soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841 with the patched image in the following sample YAML:\n apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: run: soapostinstall name: soapostinstall namespace: soans spec: containers: - image: soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841 name: soapostinstall command: [\u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sleep infinity\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects volumes: - name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soainfra-domain-pvc   Apply the YAML to create the Kubernetes pod:\n$ kubectl apply -f soapostinstall.yaml   Perform post-installation steps If you need to perform any post-installation steps on the domain home:\n  Start a bash shell in the soapostinstall pod:\n$ kubectl exec -it -n soans soapostinstall -- bash This opens a bash shell in the running soapostinstall pod:\n[oracle@soapostinstall oracle]$   Use the bash shell of the soapostinstall pod and perform the required steps on the domain home.\n  After successful completion of the post-installation steps, you can delete the soapostinstall pod:\n$ kubectl delete -f soapostinstall.yaml   Apply the patched image After completing the required SOA schema upgrade and post-installation steps, start up the domain:\n  In the domain.yaml configuration file, update the image field value with the patched image:\nFor example:\n image: soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841   In case of non-Zero Downtime Patching, update the spec.serverStartPolicy field value to IF_NEEDED (for Operator 3.x) or IfNeeded (for Operator 4.x) in domain.yaml.\n  Apply the updated domain.yaml configuration file to start up the domain.\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: In case of non-Zero Downtime Patching, the complete domain startup happens, as the servers in the domain were stopped earlier. For Zero Downtime Patching, the servers in the domain are rolling restarted.\n   Verify the domain is updated with the patched image:\n$ kubectl describe domain \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain-namespace\u0026gt;|grep \u0026quot;Image:\u0026quot; Sample output:\n$ kubectl describe domain soainfra -n soans |grep \u0026quot;Image:\u0026quot; Image: soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841 $   "

Here path-based routing is used for ingress. Sample values for default configuration are shown in the file ${WORKDIR}/charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml. By default, type is TRAEFIK, sslType is NONSSL, and domainType is soa. These values can be overridden by passing values through the command line or can be edited in the sample file values.yaml based on the type of configuration (NONSSL, SSL, and E2ESSL).\nIf needed, you can update the ingress YAML file to define more path rules (in section spec.rules.host.http.paths) based on the domain application URLs that need to be accessed. The template YAML file for the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer is located at ${WORKDIR}/charts/ingress-per-domain/templates/traefik-ingress.yaml.\n Note: See here for all the configuration parameters.\n   Choose an appropriate LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME for accessing the Oracle SOA Suite domain application URLs.\n$ export LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME=\u0026lt;LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME\u0026gt; For example, if you are executing the commands from a master node terminal, where the master hostname is LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME:\n$ export LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME=$(hostname -f)   Install ingress-per-domain using Helm for NONSSL configuration:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install soa-traefik-ingress \\  charts/ingress-per-domain \\  --namespace soans \\  --values charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml \\  --set \u0026#34;traefik.hostname=${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}\u0026#34; Sample output:\nNAME: soa-traefik-ingress LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jul 20 11:44:13 2020 NAMESPACE: soans STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None   For secured access (SSL termination and E2ESSL) to the Oracle SOA Suite application, create a certificate, and generate a Kubernetes secret:\n$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /tmp/tls1.key -out /tmp/tls1.crt -subj \u0026#34;/CN=*\u0026#34; $ kubectl -n soans create secret tls soainfra-tls-cert --key /tmp/tls1.key --cert /tmp/tls1.crt   Create the Traefik TLSStore custom resource.\nIn case of SSL termination, Traefik should be configured to use the user-defined SSL certificate.

	"description": "Set up Oracle SOA Suite Enterprise Deployment on Kubernetes.",
	"content": "This section provides recommended steps to set up Oracle SOA Suite enterprise deployment on Kubernetes to eliminate single points of failure and to provide high availability.\n Set up your Kubernetes cluster Prepare the environment  Configure firewalls and network Load Oracle SOA Suite images on all the worker nodes Enable a shared storage location for the persistent volume   Create a database and the appropriate database services Install and configure Oracle HTTP Server in the DMZ Configure a front-end load balancer Create worker nodes Apply operating system changes for Coherence Deploy WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and Oracle SOA Suite Configure redundant persistent volume Configure the required priority for mounts Set front-end addresses Enable FAN for GridLink data sources Configure ASM Configure coredns allocation Adjust server\u0026rsquo;s pods Liveness Probe  Set up your Kubernetes cluster Prepare the environment for the Kubernetes control plane (Master nodes)   Create the L4/TCP listener for the load balancer (LBR).\n  Create the LBR backend pool with the list of control plane nodes that will be added (do not use IPs, always use hostnames).\n Note: We recommend maintaining the values of the following kube-api backend pool parameters within the prescribed range to minimize the downtime while restarting the Kubernetes control pane or performing maintenance operations.\n  Healthcheck interval : Within 1000 milliseconds Healthcheck timeout : Within 900 milliseconds    Enable the L4 LBR to route to the backend set/pool.\n Note: It is important that this is an L4/TCP listener, not an HTTP/HTTPS listener.\n   Make sure that the nodes are in ready state.\n  Create an ssh key (use a common ssh key to enable access from the node executing the setup to the control plane nodes).\n  Allow traffic in intermediate firewalls between control plane nodes and the front-end LBR. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for the required ports.\n  Set up Master nodes Refer to the README to set up the master nodes.\n Note: It is recommended to set up the control plane (Master) with three nodes. See the Topology for more details.\n Prepare the environment Configure firewalls and network  Allow traffic from the load balancer (LBR) to the Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) port that will be configured (7777 by default for OHS). Allow traffic from the OHS to the node port that will be configured in the worker nodes for the Administration Server (30701), SOA cluster (30801), and Service Bus cluster (30901). Allow traffic from the worker nodes to the control plane front-end kube-api virtual server port and also to the front-end Oracle SOA Suite. Allow traffic from worker nodes to the database listener and ONS port (1521 and 6200 by default, respectively).  You can use the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite on-premise as a reference.\nLoad Oracle SOA Suite images on all the worker nodes Refer to Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image to load the images on each worker node and tag appropriately.\nEnable a shared storage location for the persistent volume A shared storage device must be used from the different worker nodes. This storage hosts the Oracle SOA Suite domain directory. Initially, a single storage location is used to create a persistent volume that will host the Oracle SOA Suite domain. Mount this shared storage (NFS/NAS) from all the worker nodes using the same mount path in all of them.\nFor example, mount NFS1 (10.10.0.21:/k8nfs) in all the worker nodes to a share directory /k8nfs:\n$ grep \u0026#34;k8nfs nfs\u0026#34; /etc/fstab 10.10.0.21:/k8nfs /k8nfs nfs rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.10.0.21,mountvers=3,mountport=2048,mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=10.10.0.21 Later, steps are provided to configure a second storage location for high availability.\nCreate a database and the appropriate database services The installation and creation of the RAC database is out of the scope of this document. Once the database is configured, the appropriate services must be created to access the schemas from the middle tier. It is critical that a precise non-default/administration service is created for Oracle SOA Suite. Refer to Preparing the Database for an Enterprise Deployment in the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4.\nInstall and configure Oracle HTTP Server in the DMZ Follow the steps in the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite to create two Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) instances in separate nodes from the worker nodes. To configure OHS with the back-end Kubernetes Oracle SOA Suite or Service Bus servers, you must use a port in the range of 30000 - 32767. You will use this port in the Oracle SOA Suite configuration scripts later on.\n Configuring Oracle HTTP Server to Route Requests to the Administration Server URL and WSMPM Configuring the Web Tier for the Oracle SOA Extended Domain Configuring the Web Tier for the Oracle Service Bus Extended Domain  In this Kubernetes Enterprise Deployment Guide, OHS routes to node ports configured for each separate Oracle SOA Suite/Service Bus cluster in the SOA domain. OHS then routes to these node ports, which redirect to the pertaining server pods. The OHS directive for the configuration must disable DynamicServerList because the node ports are not really WebLogic listeners and it is the node port configuration that maintains an intelligent list of available WebLogic servers. The OHS directive for the soa-infra mount in OHS looks like this:\n\u0026lt;Location /soa-infra\u0026gt; WLSRequest ON DynamicServerList OFF WebLogicCluster workernode1:30801,workernode2:30801,workernode3:30801 WLProxySSL OFF WLProxySSLPassThrough OFF \u0026lt;/Location\u0026gt; Similarly, the other directives for other paths should reflect similar node port addresses.\nConfigure a front-end load balancer You can either use BigIp F5 LBR or any standard LBR, such as CISCO. Refer to the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle SOA Suite for the required virtual servers: Preparing the Load Balancer and Firewalls for an Enterprise Deployment. The on-premises Enterprise Deployment Guide provides a detailed list of virtual servers/listeners that can be used for optimum isolation of services and traffic. For Kubernetes, at a minimum you should have a virtual server/listener for Oracle SOA Suite using the OHS listeners as back-end pool.\n  Create the load balancer\u0026rsquo;s L7/http listener.\n  Create a back-end pool with the list of OHS nodes/ports that will be used by Oracle SOA Suite (do not use IPs, always use hostnames).\n  Enable the L7/http listener load balancer to route to the OHS back-end set/pool.\n  Configure the front-end load balancer to route to the OHS pool.\n  Create worker nodes Refer to Set up Worker nodes for details.\nApply operating system changes for Coherence Coherence requires specific settings to create clusters in a Kubernetes environment. Refer to the steps provided in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nDeploy WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and Oracle SOA Suite The steps to deploy WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and the Oracle SOA Suite domain are automated with the scripts. Refer to the README for details.\nAfter successful Oracle SOA Suite domain creation and starting the servers, check the pods and the different services created. Once the Oracle SOA Suite managed servers reach RUNNING state (the pods are ready), check typical Oracle SOA Suite URLs using the front-end load balancer:\nSOA pods and services deployed and ready:\n$ kubectl get all -n soans NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/soaedgdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 47h pod/soaedgdomain-create-soa-infra-domain-job-6pq9z 0/1 Completed 0 68d pod/soaedgdomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 2d2h pod/soaedgdomain-soa-server2 1/1 Running 0 2d2h NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/soaedgdomain-adminserver ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 30012/TCP,7001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-adminserver-ext NodePort 10.104.20.22 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 30012:30012/TCP,7001:30701/TCP 31d service/soaedgdomain-cluster-osb-cluster ClusterIP 10.100.97.127 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9001/TCP 68d service/soaedgdomain-cluster-soa-cluster ClusterIP 10.101.101.113 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 68d service/soaedgdomain-cluster-soa-cluster-node-port NodePort 10.105.51.223 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001:30801/TCP 68d service/soaedgdomain-osb-server1 ClusterIP 10.110.81.153 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-osb-server2 ClusterIP 10.103.220.112 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-osb-server3 ClusterIP 10.97.50.117 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-osb-server4 ClusterIP 10.98.48.247 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-osb-server5 ClusterIP 10.102.137.176 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-soa-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-soa-server2 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-soa-server3 ClusterIP 10.105.108.74 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-soa-server4 ClusterIP 10.109.191.102 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 2d4h service/soaedgdomain-soa-server5 ClusterIP 10.107.2.99 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 2d4h NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/soaedgdomain-create-soa-infra-domain-job 1/1 4m24s 68d Configure redundant persistent volume To increase the flexibility in moving Oracle SOA Suite or Service Bus pods around in the Kubernetes cluster, we use node selectors where odd server pods (soa_server1, soa_server3, soa_server5, and so on) are assigned to node selector 1 and even server pods (soa_server2, soa_server4, soa_server6, and so on) are assigned to node selector 2. The resulting configuration is:\nTo use this configuration, follow these steps:\n  Stop the Oracle SOA Suite domain. Refer to Scripts to start and stop a domain.\n  Mount NFS1 in all even worker nodes and NFS2 in all odd worker nodes as in the diagram above. For example:\nMOUNT ON ODD NODE [opc@olk8-w1 ~]$ grep \u0026#34;k8nfs nfs\u0026#34; /etc/fstab 10.10.0.21:/k8nfs /k8nfs nfs rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.10.0.21,mountvers=3,mountport=2048,mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=10.10.0.21 MOUNT ON EVEN NODE [opc@olk8-w2 ~]$ grep \u0026#34;k8nfs nfs\u0026#34; /etc/fstab 10.10.0.27:/k8nfs2 /k8nfs nfs rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.10.0.27,mo untvers=3,mountport=2048,mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=10.10.0.27 MOUNT ON ODD NODE [opc@olk8-w3 ~]$ grep \u0026#34;k8nfs nfs\u0026#34; /etc/fstab 10.10.0.21:/k8nfs /k8nfs nfs rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.10.0.21,mountvers=3, mountport=2048,mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=10.10.0.21   Copy the domain mount to an NFS replica, NFS2 (this can be done through a snapshot or through direct sftp/secure copy).\nFor example, if the domain is deployed in /k8nfs hosted by NFS1, after stopping the domain, secure copy the data present at /k8nfs on NFS1 to /k8nfs2 on NFS2:\n$ cd /k8nfs $ scp -R * user@[NFS2]:/k8nfs2   Label the odd nodes for NFS1 and the even nodes for NFS2.\nFor example, add the label diskgroup=dg1 for NFS1 and diskgroup=dg2 for NFS2:\n$ kubectl label nodes olk8-w1 diskgroup=dg1 $ kubectl label nodes olk8-w2 diskgroup=dg2 $ kubectl label nodes olk8-w3 diskgroup=dg1 Verify the added labels using the following command:\n$ kubectl get nodes --show-labels Sample output is:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION LABELS olk8-m1 Ready master 10d v1.XX.X beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=olk8-m1,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/master= olk8-m2 Ready master 10d v1.XX.X beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=olk8-m2,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/master= olk8-m3 Ready master 10d v1.XX.X beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=olk8-m3,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/master= olk8-w1 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.XX.X beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,diskgroup=dg1,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=olk8-w1,kubernetes.io/os=linux,name=admin olk8-w2 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.XX.X beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,diskgroup=dg2,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=olk8-w2,kubernetes.io/os=linux,name=wls1 olk8-w3 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.XX.X beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,diskgroup=dg1,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=olk8-w3,kubernetes.io/os=linux,name=wls2   To assign the appropriate selectors in the domain:\na. Edit the domain (domain.yaml).\nb. Alter the managed servers section for all the managed servers configured in the cluster, sample for soa_server1 and soa_server2 as shown below:\nmanagedServers: - serverName: soa_server1 serverPod: nodeSelector: diskgroup: dg1 - serverName: soa_server2 serverPod: nodeSelector: diskgroup: dg2 c. Apply the domain.yaml changes:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml    IMPORTANT: Once this redundant PV configuration is in use, all changes that reside out of the config directory in the domain will need to be copied/synced to the secondary NAS mount manually. The managed servers using NFS2 in the diagram above will replicate only configuration changes that modify files/artifacts under the $DOMAIN_HOME/config directory. The rest of changes are NOT copied automatically by the WebLogic infrastructure.\n For example, if you deploy an ear and specify an upload or stage directory out of the config directory, the ear files will NOT be copied by WebLogic). Fileadapter composites will place output files in mounts accessible from the pods. The mount point and PV/PVC for the different Oracle SOA Suite server file locations need to be the same, hence a different one from the one used for the $DOMAIN_HOME location.\nConfigure the required priority for mounts When using block volume mounts for the Docker/CRIO images, it may occur that the mount takes time to complete on reboot. This is the case block volume with mount point being affected by network and storage latency. In this case, it is required to adjust the priority and dependency of the process on reboot, otherwise Docker will start and many images will be missing. To resolve this issue:\n  Identify the systemd units for the mounts that the container will depend on, including the NFS where the Oracle SOA Suite domain will reside. Identify mount systemd units in the Operating System:\n$ cat /etc/fstab | grep \u0026#34;docker ext4\u0026#34; UUID=c07d39e4-5d8f-47af-b936-bf276cc43664 /docker ext4 defaults,_netdev,nofail 0 2 $ ls /run/systemd/generator/ | grep docker docker.mount scratch-docker.mount   Add the units to the Docker/CRIO service as a dependency in the AFTER list. Identify mount systemd units in the operating system expand source:\n$ cat /lib/systemd/system/docker.service | grep After After=network-online.target firewalld.service containerd.service docker.mount   This guarantees that the container will start only after the required mount is ready.\n  Set front-end addresses For each of the Oracle SOA Suite (soa_cluster) and Service Bus (osb_cluster) clusters, set the appropriate front-end address as follows:\n  Sign in to the WebLogic Administration Console.\n  Navigate to domain_name -\u0026gt; environment -\u0026gt; clusters.\n  Click the cluster name.\n  Click the HTTP tab.\n  Enter the Frontend Host and Frontend Port details.\n   Note: Set the front-end details for each cluster and for the Administration Server.\n Enable FAN for GridLink data sources Data sources in the default deployment for Oracle SOA Suite on Kubernetes use generic data sources. With ONS auto-registration in 12.2 Database and later, it is only necessary to enable FAN for the data sources to convert to GridLink (GLDS). You can do this by using the WebLogic Administration Console or the following command and restarting the Administration Server and the managed servers:\ngrep -L fan-enabled $domain_home/config/jdbc/*.xml | xargs sed -i \u0026#34;s/\u0026lt;\\/jdbc-data-source\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;jdbc-oracle-params\u0026gt;\u0026lt;fan-enabled\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;\\/fan-enabled\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\\/jdbc-oracle-params\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\\/jdbc-data-source\u0026gt;/g\u0026#34; After the change is applied, verify that all data sources are marked as GridLink Data Sources in the WebLogic Administration Console.\nConfigure ASM Refer to the on-premises Enterprise Deployment Guide for steps to configure Automatic Service Migration.\nConfigure coredns allocation  NOTE: This step is applicable to any Kubernetes system using coredns regardless of Oracle SOA Suite deployment. However, the worker node creation is implicit in the setup, hence it is applied in this context (post Oracle SOA Suite deployment).\n Configure replicas for cordens to spawn both control plane and master plane. If a restore operation is performed on the control plane, worker nodes may stop working properly. If the coredns lands entirely in the worker nodes, the control plane may not function correctly if they are brought down for maintenance. Place at least two coredns pods on the control plane and another two on the worker nodes. The coredns footprint is low.\nVIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 146268 41684 29088 S 0.3 0.1 25:44.04 coredns According to the CoreDNS documentation, you can estimate the amount of memory required for a CoreDNS instance (using default settings) with the following formula:\nMB required (default settings) = (Pods + Services) / 1000 + 54 Hence, first label nodes in both control and worker plane.\n$ kubectl label nodes olk8-m1 area=dnsarea $ kubectl label nodes olk8-m2 area=dnsarea $ kubectl label nodes olk8-m3 area=dnsarea $ kubectl label nodes olk8-w1 area=dnsarea $ kubectl label nodes olk8-w2 area=dnsarea $ kubectl label nodes olk8-w3 area=dnsarea And then update the coredns deployment to use topology spread constraints\n NOTE: Topology spread constraints is beta starting in Kubernetes v1.18\n First, enable the feature gate in kube-api server and in kube-scheduler. Then, modify the coredns deployment for an appropriate spread of pods across worker and control plane nodes.\nThe coredns topology spread config details are:\nClick below for sample updated coredns deployment:   Coredns deployment YAML    $ kubectl get deployment coredns -n kube-system -o yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: annotations: deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: \u0026quot;7\u0026quot;

Note that this walkthrough is for demonstration purposes only, not for use in production. These instructions assume that you are already familiar with Kubernetes. If you need more detailed instructions, refer to the Install Guide.\nHardware requirements The Linux kernel supported for deploying and running Oracle SOA Suite domains with the operator is Oracle Linux 7 (UL6+) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (UL3+ only with standalone Kubernetes). Refer to the prerequisites for more details.\nFor this exercise, the minimum hardware requirements to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster and then deploy the soaosb (Oracle SOA Suite, Oracle Service Bus, and Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)) domain type with one Managed Server for Oracle SOA Suite and one for the Oracle Service Bus cluster, along with Oracle Database running as a container are:\n   Hardware Size     RAM 32GB   Disk Space 250GB+   CPU core(s) 6    See here for resource sizing information for Oracle SOA Suite domains set up on a Kubernetes cluster.\nSet up Oracle SOA Suite in an on-premise environment Use the steps in this topic to create a single-instance on-premise Kubernetes cluster and then create an Oracle SOA Suite soaosb domain type, which deploys a domain with Oracle SOA Suite, Oracle Service Bus, and Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS).\n Step 1 - Prepare a virtual machine for the Kubernetes cluster Step 2 - Set up a single instance Kubernetes cluster Step 3 - Get scripts and images Step 4 - Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Step 5 - Install the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer Step 6 - Create and configure an Oracle SOA Suite domain  1.

The Docker directory should be on a disk with a lot of free space (more than 100GB) because it will be used for the Docker file system, which contains all of your images and containers. The Kubernetes directory is used for the /var/lib/kubelet file system and persistent volume storage.\n$ export docker_dir=/u01/docker $ export kubelet_dir=/u01/kubelet $ mkdir -p $docker_dir $kubelet_dir $ ln -s $kubelet_dir /var/lib/kubelet   Verify that IPv4 forwarding is enabled on your host.\nNote: Replace eth0 with the ethernet interface name of your compute resource if it is different.\n$ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding\u0026#39; $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding\u0026#39; $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding\u0026#39; $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind\u0026#39; For example: Verify that all are set to 1:\n$ net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1 Solution: Set all values to 1 immediately:\n$ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1   To preserve the settings permanently: Update the above values to 1 in files in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/, /run/sysctl.d/, and /etc/sysctl.d/.\n  Verify the iptables rule for forwarding.\nKubernetes uses iptables to handle many networking and port forwarding rules. A standard Docker installation may create a firewall rule that prevents forwarding.\nVerify if the iptables rule to accept forwarding traffic is set:\n$ /sbin/iptables -L -n | awk \u0026#39;/Chain FORWARD / {print $4}\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#34;)\u0026#34; If the output is \u0026ldquo;DROP\u0026rdquo;, then run the following command:\n$ /sbin/iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT Verify if the iptables rule is properly set to \u0026ldquo;ACCEPT\u0026rdquo;:\n$ /sbin/iptables -L -n | awk \u0026#39;/Chain FORWARD / {print $4}\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#34;)\u0026#34;   Disable and stop firewalld:\n$ systemctl disable firewalld $ systemctl stop firewalld   1.2 Install and configure Docker  Note: If you have already installed Docker with version 19.03.1+ and configured the Docker daemon root to sufficient disk space along with proxy settings, continue to Install and configure Kubernetes.\n   Make sure that you have the right operating system version:\n$ uname -a $ more /etc/oracle-release Example output:\nLinux xxxxxxx 4.1.12-124.27.1.el7uek.x86_64 #2 SMP Mon May 13 08:56:17 PDT 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Oracle Linux Server release 7.6   Install the latest docker-engine and start the Docker service:\n$ docker_version=\u0026#34;19.03.1.ol\u0026#34; $ yum-config-manager --enable ol7_addons $ yum install docker-engine-$docker_version $ systemctl enable docker $ systemctl start docker   Add your user ID to the Docker group to allow you to run Docker commands without root access:\n$ /sbin/usermod -a -G docker \u0026lt;YOUR_USERID\u0026gt;   Check that your Docker version is at least 18.03:\n$ docker version Example output:\nClient: Docker Engine - Community Version: 19.03.1-ol API version: 1.40 Go version: go1.12.5 Git commit: ead9442 Built: Wed Sep 11 06:40:28 2019 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 Experimental: false Server: Docker Engine - Community Engine: Version: 19.03.1-ol API version: 1.40 (minimum version 1.12) Go version: go1.12.5 Git commit: ead9442 Built: Wed Sep 11 06:38:43 2019 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 Experimental: false Default Registry: docker.io containerd: Version: v1.2.0-rc.0-108-gc444666 GitCommit: c4446665cb9c30056f4998ed953e6d4ff22c7c39 runc: Version: 1.0.0-rc5+dev GitCommit: 4bb1fe4ace1a32d3676bb98f5d3b6a4e32bf6c58 docker-init: Version: 0.18.0 GitCommit: fec3683   Update the Docker engine configuration:\n$ mkdir -p /etc/docker $ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; /etc/docker/daemon.json { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;docker\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data-root\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/u01/docker\u0026#34; } EOF   Configure proxy settings if you are behind an HTTP proxy:\n### Create the drop-in file /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf that contains proxy details: $ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf [Service] Environment=\u0026#34;HTTP_PROXY=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT\u0026#34; Environment=\u0026#34;HTTPS_PROXY=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT\u0026#34; Environment=\u0026#34;NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST,/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; EOF  Note: On some hosts /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d may not be available.

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \u0026#34;hello-world\u0026#34; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal. To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with: $ docker run -it ubuntu bash Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID: https://hub.docker.com/ For more examples and ideas, visit: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/   1.3 Install and configure Kubernetes   Add the external Kubernetes repository:\n$ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo [kubernetes] name=Kubernetes baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-\\$basearch enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 repo_gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg exclude=kubelet kubeadm kubectl EOF   Set SELinux in permissive mode (effectively disabling it):\n$ export PATH=/sbin:$PATH $ setenforce 0 $ sed -i \u0026#39;s/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=permissive/\u0026#39; /etc/selinux/config   Export proxy and install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl:\n### Get the nslookup IP address of the master node to use with apiserver-advertise-address during setting up Kubernetes master ### as the host may have different internal ip (hostname -i) and nslookup $HOSTNAME $ ip_addr=`nslookup $(hostname -f) | grep -m2 Address | tail -n1| awk -F: \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39;| tr -d \u0026#34; \u0026#34;` $ echo $ip_addr ### Set the proxies $ export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST,/var/run/docker.sock,$ip_addr,.svc $ export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST,/var/run/docker.sock,$ip_addr,.svc $ export http_proxy=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT $ export https_proxy=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT $ export HTTPS_PROXY=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT $ export HTTP_PROXY=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT ### Install Kubernetes $ VERSION=1.23.6-0 $ yum install -y kubelet-$VERSION kubeadm-$VERSION kubectl-$VERSION --disableexcludes=kubernetes ### Enable kubelet service so that it automatically restarts on reboot $ systemctl enable --now kubelet   Ensure net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables is set to 1 in your sysctl to avoid traffic routing issues:\n$ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1 EOF $ sysctl --system   Disable swap check:\n$ sed -i \u0026#39;s/KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=/KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=\u0026#34;--fail-swap-on=false\u0026#34;/\u0026#39; /etc/sysconfig/kubelet $ cat /etc/sysconfig/kubelet ### Reload and restart kubelet $ systemctl daemon-reload $ systemctl restart kubelet   From Kubernetes version v1.22 onward, kubeadm will default cgroup-driver to systemd.

Set up a single instance Kubernetes cluster  Notes:\n These steps must be run with the root user, unless specified otherwise! If you choose to use a different CIDR block (that is, other than 10.244.0.0/16 for the --pod-network-cidr= in the kubeadm init command), then also update NO_PROXY and no_proxy with the appropriate value.  Also make sure to update kube-flannel.yaml with the new value before deploying.   Replace the following with appropriate values:  ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT     2.1 Set up the master node   Create a shell script that sets up the necessary environment variables. You can append this to the user’s .bashrc so that it will run at login. You must also configure your proxy settings here if you are behind an HTTP proxy:\n## grab my IP address to pass into kubeadm init, and to add to no_proxy vars ip_addr=`nslookup $(hostname -f) | grep -m2 Address | tail -n1| awk -F: \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39;| tr -d \u0026#34; \u0026#34;` export pod_network_cidr=\u0026#34;10.244.0.0/16\u0026#34; export service_cidr=\u0026#34;10.96.0.0/12\u0026#34; export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin ### Set the proxies export NO_PROXY=localhost,.svc,127.0.0.0/8,ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST,/var/run/docker.sock,$ip_addr,$pod_network_cidr,$service_cidr export no_proxy=localhost,.svc,127.0.0.0/8,ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST,/var/run/docker.sock,$ip_addr,$pod_network_cidr,$service_cidr export http_proxy=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT export https_proxy=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT export HTTPS_PROXY=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT export HTTP_PROXY=http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT   Source the script to set up your environment variables:\n$ . ~/.bashrc   To implement command completion, add the following to the script:\n$ [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion $ source \u0026lt;(kubectl completion bash)   Run kubeadm init to create the master node:\n$ kubeadm init \\  --pod-network-cidr=$pod_network_cidr \\  --apiserver-advertise-address=$ip_addr \\  --ignore-preflight-errors=Swap \u0026gt; /tmp/kubeadm-init.out 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1   Log in to the terminal with YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP. Then set up the ~/.bashrc similar to steps 1 to 3 with YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP.\n Note that from now on we will be using YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP to execute any kubectl commands and not root.\n   Set up YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP to access the Kubernetes cluster:\n$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube $ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config $ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config   Verify that YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP is set up to access the Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl command:\n$ kubectl get nodes  Note: At this step, the node is not in ready state as we have not yet installed the pod network add-on. After the next step, the node will show status as Ready.\n   Install a pod network add-on (flannel) so that your pods can communicate with each other.\n Note: If you are using a different CIDR block than 10.244.0.0/16, then download and update kube-flannel.yml with the correct CIDR address before deploying into the cluster:\n $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/v0.17.0/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml $ ### Update the CIDR address if you are using a CIDR block other than the default 10.244.0.0/16 $ kubectl apply -f kube-flannel.yml   Verify that the master node is in Ready status:\n$ kubectl get nodes Sample output:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION mymasternode Ready control-plane,master 12h v1.23.6 or:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system Sample output:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/coredns-86c58d9df4-58p9f 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/coredns-86c58d9df4-mzrr5 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/etcd-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 3m4s pod/kube-apiserver-node 1/1 Running 0 3m21s pod/kube-controller-manager-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 3m25s pod/kube-flannel-ds-6npx4 1/1 Running 0 49s pod/kube-proxy-4vsgm 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/kube-scheduler-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 2m58s   To schedule pods on the master node, taint the node:\n$ kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-   Congratulations! Your Kubernetes cluster environment is ready to deploy your Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nRefer to the official documentation to set up a Kubernetes cluster.\n3. Get scripts and images 3.1 Set up the source code repository to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains   Create a working directory to set up the source code:\n$ mkdir $HOME/soa_23.4.2 $ cd $HOME/soa_23.4.2   Download the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator source code and Oracle SOA Suite Kubernetes deployment scripts from the SOA repository. Required artifacts are available at OracleSOASuite/kubernetes.\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git $ export WORKDIR=$HOME/soa_23.4.2/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes   3.2 Get required Docker images and add them to your local registry   Pull the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator image:\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:4.1.4   Obtain the Oracle Database image and Oracle SOA Suite Docker image from the Oracle Container Registry:\na. For first time users, to pull an image from the Oracle Container Registry, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in using the Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication service. If you do not already have SSO credentials, you can create an Oracle Account using: https://profile.oracle.com/myprofile/account/create-account.jspx.\nUse the web interface to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions for the Oracle software images that you intend to deploy. Your acceptance of these terms are stored in a database that links the software images to your Oracle Single Sign-On login credentials.\nTo obtain the image, log in to the Oracle Container Registry:\n$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com b. Find and then pull the Oracle Database image for 12.2.0.1:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim c. Find and then pull the prebuilt Oracle SOA Suite image 12.2.1.4 install image:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4  Note: This image does not contain any Oracle SOA Suite product patches and can only be used for test and development purposes.\n   4. Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.1 Prepare for the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.   Create a namespace opns for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns   Create a service account op-sa for the operator in the operator’s namespace:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa   4.2 Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Use Helm to install and start the operator from the directory you just cloned:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator \\  --namespace opns \\  --set image=ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:4.1.4 \\  --set serviceAccount=op-sa \\  --wait 4.3 Verify the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator   Verify that the operator’s pod is running by listing the pods in the operator’s namespace. You should see one for the operator:\n$ kubectl get pods -n opns   Verify that the operator is up and running by viewing the operator pod\u0026rsquo;s logs:\n$ kubectl logs -n opns -c weblogic-operator deployments/weblogic-operator   The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator v4.1.4 has been installed. Continue with the load balancer and Oracle SOA Suite domain setup.\n5. Install the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator supports these load balancers: Traefik, NGINX, and Apache. Samples are provided in the documentation.\nThis Quick Start demonstrates how to install the Traefik ingress controller to provide load balancing for an Oracle SOA Suite domain.\n  Create a namespace for Traefik:\n$ kubectl create namespace traefik   Set up Helm for 3rd party services:\n$ helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik --force-update   Install the Traefik operator in the traefik namespace with the provided sample values:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install traefik traefik/traefik \\  --namespace traefik \\  --values charts/traefik/values.yaml \\  --set \u0026#34;kubernetes.namespaces={traefik}\u0026#34; \\  --set \u0026#34;service.type=NodePort\u0026#34; \\  --wait   6. Create and configure an Oracle SOA Suite domain 6.1 Prepare for an Oracle SOA Suite domain   Create a namespace that can host Oracle SOA Suite domains. Label the namespace with weblogic-operator=enabled to manage the domain.\n$ kubectl create namespace soans $ kubectl label namespace soans weblogic-operator=enabled   Create Kubernetes secrets.\na. Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain. In this example, the username is weblogic, the password is Welcome1, and the namespace is soans:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh \\  -u weblogic \\  -p Welcome1 \\  -n soans \\  -d soainfra \\  -s soainfra-domain-credentials b. Create a Kubernetes secret for the RCU in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n Schema user : SOA1 Schema password : Oradoc_db1 DB sys user password : Oradoc_db1 Domain name : soainfra Domain Namespace : soans Secret name : soainfra-rcu-credentials  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-credentials $ ./create-rcu-credentials.sh \\  -u SOA1 \\  -p Oradoc_db1 \\  -a sys \\  -q Oradoc_db1 \\  -d soainfra \\  -n soans \\  -s soainfra-rcu-credentials   Create the Kubernetes persistence volume and persistence volume claim.\na. Create the Oracle SOA Suite domain home directory. Determine if a user already exists on your host system with uid:gid of 1000:0:\n$ sudo getent passwd 1000 If this command returns a username (which is the first field), you can skip the following useradd command. If not, create the oracle user with useradd:\n$ sudo useradd -u 1000 -g 0 oracle Create the directory that will be used for the Oracle SOA Suite domain home:\n$ sudo mkdir /scratch/k8s_dir $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/k8s_dir b. The create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml has the following values by default:\n baseName: domain domainUID: soainfra namespace: soans weblogicDomainStoragePath: /scratch/k8s_dir  Review and update if any changes required.\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ vim create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml c. Run the create-pv-pvc.sh script to create the PV and PVC configuration files:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ ./create-pv-pvc.sh -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml -o output d. Create the PV and PVC using the configuration files created in the previous step:\n$ kubectl create -f output/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f output/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pvc.yaml   Install and configure the database for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nThis step is required only when a standalone database is not already set up and you want to use the database in a container.\nThe Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1). For production, it is suggested to use a standalone database. This example provides steps to create the database in a container.\n a. Create a secret with your desired password (for example, Oradoc_db1):\n$ kubectl create secret generic oracle-db-secret --from-literal=\u0026#39;password=Oradoc_db1\u0026#39; b. Create a database in a container:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-oracle-db-service $ ./start-db-service.sh -a oracle-db-secret -i container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim -p none Once the database is successfully created, you can use the database connection string oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s as an rcuDatabaseURL parameter in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file.\nc. Create Oracle SOA Suite schemas for the domain type (for example, soaosb).\nCreate a secret that contains the database\u0026rsquo;s SYSDBA username and password.\n$ kubectl -n default create secret generic oracle-rcu-secret \\  --from-literal=\u0026#39;sys_username=sys\u0026#39; \\  --from-literal=\u0026#39;sys_password=Oradoc_db1\u0026#39; \\  --from-literal=\u0026#39;password=Oradoc_db1\u0026#39; To install the Oracle SOA Suite schemas, run the create-rcu-schema.sh script with the following inputs:\n -s \u0026lt;RCU PREFIX\u0026gt; -t \u0026lt;SOA domain type\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;Oracle Database URL\u0026gt; -i \u0026lt;SOASuite image\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;Namespace\u0026gt; -c \u0026lt;Name of credentials secret containing SYSDBA username and password and RCU schema owner password\u0026gt; -r \u0026lt;Comma-separated variables\u0026gt; -l \u0026lt;Timeout limit in seconds.

(default: 300)\u0026gt;  For example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-schema $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh \\ -s SOA1 \\ -t soaosb \\ -d oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s \\ -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4 \\ -n default \\ -c oracle-rcu-secret \\ -r SOA_PROFILE_TYPE=SMALL,HEALTHCARE_INTEGRATION=NO   Now the environment is ready to start the Oracle SOA Suite domain creation.\n6.2 Create an Oracle SOA Suite domain   The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv. You must edit create-domain-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain.\nUpdate create-domain-inputs.yaml with the following values for domain creation:\n domainType: soaosb initialManagedServerReplicas: 1  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/ $ cp create-domain-inputs.yaml create-domain-inputs.yaml.orig $ sed -i -e \u0026#34;s:domainType\\: soa:domainType\\: soaosb:g\u0026#34; create-domain-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026#34;s:initialManagedServerReplicas\\: 2:initialManagedServerReplicas\\: 1:g\u0026#34; create-domain-inputs.yaml $ sed -i -e \u0026#34;s:image\\: soasuite\\:12.2.1.4:image\\: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite\\:12.2.1.4:g\u0026#34; create-domain-inputs.yaml   Run the create-domain.sh script to create a domain:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/ $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output   Create a Kubernetes domain object:\nOnce the create-domain.sh is successful, it generates output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml, which you can use to create the Kubernetes resource domain to start the domain and servers:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ kubectl create -f output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml   Verify that the Kubernetes domain object named soainfra is created:\n$ kubectl get domain -n soans NAME AGE soainfra 3m18s   Once you create the domain, the introspect pod is created. This inspects the domain home and then starts the soainfra-adminserver pod. Once the soainfra-adminserver pod starts successfully, the Managed Server pods are started in parallel. Watch the soans namespace for the status of domain creation:\n$ kubectl get pods -n soans -w   Verify that the Oracle SOA Suite domain server pods and services are created and in Ready state:\n$ kubectl get all -n soans   6.3 Configure Traefik to access Oracle SOA Suite domain services   Configure Traefik to manage ingresses created in the Oracle SOA Suite domain namespace (soans):\n$ helm upgrade traefik traefik/traefik \\  --reuse-values \\  --namespace traefik \\  --set \u0026#34;kubernetes.namespaces={traefik,soans}\u0026#34; \\  --wait   Create an ingress for the domain in the domain namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ export LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME=$(hostname -f) $ helm install soa-traefik-ingress charts/ingress-per-domain \\ --namespace soans \\ --values charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml \\ --set \u0026#34;traefik.hostname=${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}\u0026#34; \\ --set domainType=soaosb   Verify the created ingress per domain details:\n$ kubectl describe ingress soainfra-traefik -n soans   6.4 Verify that you can access the Oracle SOA Suite domain URL   Get the LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME for your environment:\n$ export LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME=$(hostname -f)   Verify the following URLs are available for Oracle SOA Suite domains of domain type soaosb:\nCredentials:\nusername: weblogic password: Welcome1\nhttp://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/console http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/em http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/servicebus http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/soa-infra http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/soa/composer http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/integration/worklistapp http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/ess http://${LOADBALANCER_HOSTNAME}:30305/EssHealthCheck   "

For Helm installation and usage information, see here.\nGet dependent images Obtain dependent images and add them to your local registry.\n  For first time users, to pull an image from the Oracle Container Registry, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in using the Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication service. If you do not already have an SSO account, you can create an Oracle Account here.\nUse the web interface to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions for the Oracle software images that you intend to deploy. Your acceptance of these terms are stored in a database that links the software images to your Oracle Single Sign-On login credentials.\nLog in to the Oracle Container Registry (container-registry.oracle.com) from your Docker client:\n$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com   Pull the operator image:\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:4.1.4   Set up the code repository to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment on Kubernetes leverages the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator infrastructure. To deploy an Oracle SOA Suite domain, you must set up the deployment scripts.\n  Create a working directory to set up the source code:\n$ mkdir $HOME/soa_23.4.2 $ cd $HOME/soa_23.4.2   Download the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator source code and Oracle SOA Suite Kubernetes deployment scripts from the SOA repository. Required artifacts are available at OracleSOASuite/kubernetes.\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git $ export WORKDIR=$HOME/soa_23.4.2/fmw-kubernetes/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes   Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image The Oracle SOA Suite image with the latest bundle patch and required interim patches is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4.0, the April Patch Set Update (PSU), and other fixes released with the Critical Patch Update (CPU) program. The Oracle Container Registry hosts container images based on both Oracle Linux 7 (ol7) and 8 (ol8). These are the only images supported for production deployments. Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite images using either of the following methods:\n  Download from Oracle Container Registry:\n  Log in to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; soasuite_cpu and accept the license agreement if not already done.\n  Log in to the Oracle Container Registry (container-registry.oracle.com) from your Docker client:\n$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com   Pull the Oracle Linux 7 or 8 based images:\nFor example:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-\u0026lt;ol7 or ol8\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;TAG\u0026gt;     Download from My Oracle Support:\n  Download patch 35908803 for Oracle Linux 7 based container image or 35915091 for Oracle Linux 8 based container image from My Oracle Support (MOS).\n  Unzip the downloaded patch zip file.\n  Load the image archive using the docker load command.\nFor example:\n$ docker load \u0026lt; soasuite-12.2.1.4-jdk8-\u0026lt;ol7 or ol8\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;TAG\u0026gt;.tar Loaded image: oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4-jdk8-\u0026lt;ol7 or ol8\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;TAG\u0026gt; $   Run the docker inspect command to verify that the downloaded image is the latest released image. The value of label com.oracle.weblogic.imagetool.buildid must match to 40af8c36-79ce-466e-8915-483547b6aa4b for Oracle Linux 7 based container image and abe2fde0-4f44-422b-a50f-23fdd257bcc1 for Oracle Linux 8 based container image.\nFor example:\n$ docker inspect --format=\u0026#39;{{ index .Config.Labels \u0026#34;com.oracle.weblogic.imagetool.buildid\u0026#34; }}\u0026#39; oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-231016.113116 40af8c36-79ce-466e-8915-483547b6aa4b $     If you want to build and use an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with any additional bundle patch or interim patches that are not part of the image obtained from My Oracle Support, then follow these steps to create the image.\n Note: The default Oracle SOA Suite image name used for Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment is soasuite:12.2.1.4. The image obtained must be tagged as soasuite:12.2.1.4 using the docker tag command. If you want to use a different name for the image, make sure to update the new image tag name in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file and also in other instances where the soasuite:12.2.1.4 image name is used.\n Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator supports the deployment of Oracle SOA Suite domains in the Kubernetes environment. Follow the steps in this document to install the operator.\n Note: Optionally, you can follow these steps to send the contents of the operator\u0026rsquo;s logs to Elasticsearch.\n In the following example commands to install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, opns is the namespace and op-sa is the service account created for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns $ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa $ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator --namespace opns --set serviceAccount=op-sa --set \u0026quot;javaLoggingLevel=FINE\u0026quot; --wait This Helm release deploys the operator with the default behavior of managing Oracle SOA Suite domains in all Kubernetes namespaces with the label weblogic-operator=enabled.\nPrepare the environment for Oracle SOA Suite domains Create a namespace for an Oracle SOA Suite domain Create a Kubernetes namespace (for example, soans) for the domain unless you intend to use the default namespace. Label the namespace with weblogic-operator=enabled to manage the domain. Use the new namespace in the remaining steps in this section. For details, see Prepare to run a domain.\n$ kubectl create namespace soans $ kubectl label namespace soans weblogic-operator=enabled Create a persistent storage for an Oracle SOA Suite domain In the Kubernetes namespace you created, create the PV and PVC for the domain by running the create-pv-pvc.sh script. Follow the instructions for using the script to create a dedicated PV and PVC for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\n  Review the configuration parameters for PV creation here. Based on your requirements, update the values in the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file located at ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc/. Sample configuration parameter values for an Oracle SOA Suite domain are:\n baseName: domain domainUID: soainfra namespace: soans weblogicDomainStorageType: HOST_PATH weblogicDomainStoragePath: /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA    Ensure that the path for the weblogicDomainStoragePath property exists and have the ownership for 1000:0. If not, you need to create it as follows:\n$ sudo mkdir /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA   Run the create-pv-pvc.sh script:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ ./create-pv-pvc.sh -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml -o output_soainfra   The create-pv-pvc.sh script will create a subdirectory pv-pvcs under the given /path/to/output-directory directory and creates two YAML configuration files for PV and PVC. Apply these two YAML files to create the PV and PVC Kubernetes resources using the kubectl create -f command:\n$ kubectl create -f output_soainfra/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f output_soainfra/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pvc.yaml   Create a Kubernetes secret with domain credentials Create the Kubernetes secrets username and password of the administrative account in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n $ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p Welcome1 -n soans -d soainfra -s soainfra-domain-credentials For more details, see this document.\nYou can check the secret with the kubectl get secret command.\nFor example:\n  Click here to see the sample secret description.   $ kubectl get secret soainfra-domain-credentials -o yaml -n soans apiVersion: v1 data: password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_username: c3lz username: U09BMQ== kind: Secret metadata: creationTimestamp: \u0026quot;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026quot; labels: weblogic.domainName: soainfra weblogic.domainUID: soainfra managedFields: - apiVersion: v1 fieldsType: FieldsV1 fieldsV1: f:data: .: {} f:password: {} f:sys_password: {} f:sys_username: {} f:username: {} f:metadata: f:labels: .: {} f:weblogic.domainName: {} f:weblogic.domainUID: {} f:type: {} manager: kubectl operation: Update time: \u0026quot;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026quot; name: soainfra-rcu-credentials namespace: soans resourceVersion: \u0026quot;265386\u0026quot; selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-rcu-credentials uid: 2d93941c-656b-43a4-8af2-78ca8be0f293 type: Opaque    Create a Kubernetes secret with the RCU credentials You also need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials for the database schemas. When you create your domain, it will obtain the RCU credentials from this secret.\nUse the provided sample script to create the secret:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-credentials $ ./create-rcu-credentials.sh \\  -u SOA1 \\  -p Oradoc_db1 \\  -a sys \\  -q Oradoc_db1 \\  -d soainfra \\  -n soans \\  -s soainfra-rcu-credentials The parameter values are:\n -u username for schema owner (regular user), required. -p password for schema owner (regular user), required. -a username for SYSDBA user, required. -q password for SYSDBA user, required. -d domainUID. Example: soainfra -n namespace. Example: soans -s secretName. Example: soainfra-rcu-credentials  You can confirm the secret was created as expected with the kubectl get secret command.\nFor example:\n  Click here to see the sample secret description.   $ kubectl get secret soainfra-rcu-credentials -o yaml -n soans apiVersion: v1 data: password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_username: c3lz username: U09BMQ== kind: Secret metadata: creationTimestamp: \u0026#34;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026#34; labels: weblogic.domainName: soainfra weblogic.domainUID: soainfra managedFields: - apiVersion: v1 fieldsType: FieldsV1 fieldsV1: f:data: .: {} f:password: {} f:sys_password: {} f:sys_username: {} f:username: {} f:metadata: f:labels: .: {} f:weblogic.domainName: {} f:weblogic.domainUID: {} f:type: {} manager: kubectl operation: Update time: \u0026#34;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026#34; name: soainfra-rcu-credentials namespace: soans resourceVersion: \u0026#34;265386\u0026#34; selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-rcu-credentials uid: 2d93941c-656b-43a4-8af2-78ca8be0f293 type: Opaque    Configure access to your database Oracle SOA Suite domains require a database with the necessary schemas installed in them. The Repository Creation Utility (RCU) allows you to create those schemas. You must set up the database before you create your domain. There are no additional requirements added by running Oracle SOA Suite in Kubernetes; the same existing requirements apply.\nFor production deployments, you must set up and use the standalone (non-container) based database running outside of Kubernetes.\nBefore creating a domain, you will need to set up the necessary schemas in your database.\nRun the Repository Creation Utility to set up your database schemas Create schemas The RCU pod requires that you create a secret in the same namespace as the RCU pod that contains the database\u0026rsquo;s SYSDBA username and password in its sys_username and sys_password fields, and also contains a password of your choice for RCU schemas in its password field.\nFor example:\n$ kubectl -n default create secret generic oracle-rcu-secret \\  --from-literal=\u0026#39;sys_username=sys\u0026#39; \\  --from-literal=\u0026#39;sys_password=MY_SYS_PASSWORD\u0026#39; \\  --from-literal=\u0026#39;password=MY_RCU_SCHEMA_PASSWORD\u0026#39; To create the database schemas for Oracle SOA Suite, run the create-rcu-schema.sh script.\nFor example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-schema $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh -h usage: ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s \u0026lt;schemaPrefix\u0026gt; [-t \u0026lt;schemaType\u0026gt;] [-d \u0026lt;dburl\u0026gt;] [-n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;] [-c \u0026lt;credentialsSecretName\u0026gt;] [-p \u0026lt;docker-store\u0026gt;] [-i \u0026lt;image\u0026gt;] [-u \u0026lt;imagePullPolicy\u0026gt;] [-o \u0026lt;rcuOutputDir\u0026gt;] [-r \u0026lt;customVariables\u0026gt;] [-l \u0026lt;timeoutLimit\u0026gt;] [-h] -s RCU Schema Prefix (required) -t RCU Schema Type (optional) (supported values: osb,soa,soaosb) -d RCU Oracle Database URL (optional) (default: oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s) -n Namespace for RCU pod (optional) (default: default) -c Name of credentials secret (optional) (default: oracle-rcu-secret) Must contain SYSDBA username at key \u0026#39;sys_username\u0026#39;, SYSDBA password at key \u0026#39;sys_password\u0026#39;, and RCU schema owner password at key \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;. -p OracleSOASuite ImagePullSecret (optional) (default: none) -i OracleSOASuite Image (optional) (default: soasuite:12.2.1.4) -u OracleSOASuite ImagePullPolicy (optional) (default: IfNotPresent) -o Output directory for the generated YAML file (optional) (default: rcuoutput) -r Comma-separated custom variables in the format variablename=value (optional) (default: none) -l Timeout limit in seconds (optional) (default: 300) -h Help NOTE: The c, p, i, u, and o arguments are ignored if an RCU pod is already running in the namespace. $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh \\  -s SOA1 \\  -t soaosb \\  -d oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s \\  -n default \\  -c oracle-rcu-secret \\  -i soasuite:12.2.1.4 \\  -r SOA_PROFILE_TYPE=SMALL,HEALTHCARE_INTEGRATION=NO For Oracle SOA Suite domains, the create-rcu-schema.sh script supports:\n domain types: soa, osb, and soaosb. You must specify one of these using the -t flag. For Oracle SOA Suite you must specify the Oracle SOA schema profile type using the -r flag. For example, -r SOA_PROFILE_TYPE=SMALL. Supported values for SOA_PROFILE_TYPE are SMALL, MED, and LARGE.   Note: To use the LARGE schema profile type, make sure that the partitioning feature is enabled in the Oracle Database.\n Make sure that you maintain the association between the database schemas and the matching domain just like you did in a non-Kubernetes environment. There is no specific functionality provided to help with this.\nDrop schemas If you want to drop a schema, you can use the drop-rcu-schema.sh script.\nFor example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-schema $ ./drop-rcu-schema.sh -h usage: ./drop-rcu-schema.sh -s \u0026lt;schemaPrefix\u0026gt; [-t \u0026lt;schemaType\u0026gt;] [-d \u0026lt;dburl\u0026gt;] [-n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;] [-c \u0026lt;credentialsSecretName\u0026gt;] [-p \u0026lt;docker-store\u0026gt;] [-i \u0026lt;image\u0026gt;] [-u \u0026lt;imagePullPolicy\u0026gt;] [-o \u0026lt;rcuOutputDir\u0026gt;] [-r \u0026lt;customVariables\u0026gt;] [-h] -s RCU Schema Prefix (required) -t RCU Schema Type (optional) (supported values: osb,soa,soaosb) -d RCU Oracle Database URL (optional) (default: oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s) -n Namespace for RCU pod (optional) (default: default) -c Name of credentials secret (optional) (default: oracle-rcu-secret) Must contain SYSDBA username at key \u0026#39;sys_username\u0026#39;, SYSDBA password at key \u0026#39;sys_password\u0026#39;, and RCU schema owner password at key \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;. -p OracleSOASuite ImagePullSecret (optional) (default: none) -i OracleSOASuite Image (optional) (default: soasuite:12.2.1.4) -u OracleSOASuite ImagePullPolicy (optional) (default: IfNotPresent) -o Output directory for the generated YAML file (optional) (default: rcuoutput) -r Comma-separated custom variables in the format variablename=value (optional) (default: none) -h Help NOTE: The c, p, i, u, and o arguments are ignored if an RCU pod is already running in the namespace. $ ./drop-rcu-schema.sh \\  -s SOA1 \\  -t soaosb \\  -d oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s \\  -n default \\  -c oracle-rcu-secret \\  -r SOA_PROFILE_TYPE=SMALL,HEALTHCARE_INTEGRATION=NO For Oracle SOA Suite domains, the drop-rcu-schema.sh script supports:\n Domain types: soa, osb, and soaosb.

Make sure to provide oracle user ( uid: 1000 and gid: 0) permission to directory /share/soa-deploy, so that it is accessible and writable inside the container.\n$ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /share/soa-deploy Follow the steps in this section to create a container and then use it to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications using Maven or Ant.\nCreate a composite deployment container Before creating a Kubernetes pod, make sure that the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image is available on a node, or you can create an image pull secret so that the pod can pull the Docker image on the host where it gets created.\n  Create an image pull secret to pull image soasuite:12.2.1.4 by the Kubernetes pod:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry image-secret -n soans --docker-server=your-registry.com --docker-username=xxxxxx --docker-password=xxxxxxx --docker-email=my@company.com   Create a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim (soadeploy-pv.yaml and soadeploy-pvc.yaml) with sample composites for build and deploy placed at /share/soa-deploy.\na) Create a PersistentVolume with the sample provided (soadeploy-pv.yaml), which uses NFS (you can use hostPath or any other supported PV type):\napiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: soadeploy-pv spec: storageClassName: soadeploy-storage-class capacity: storage: 10Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteMany # Valid values are Retain, Delete or Recycle persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain # hostPath: nfs: server: X.X.X.X path: \u0026quot;/share/soa-deploy\u0026quot; b) Apply the YAML:\n$ kubectl apply -f soadeploy-pv.yaml c) Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (soadeploy-pvc.yaml):\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: soadeploy-pvc namespace: soans spec: storageClassName: soadeploy-storage-class accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 10Gi d) Apply the YAML:\n$ kubectl apply -f soadeploy-pvc.yaml   Create a composite deploy pod using soadeploy.yaml to mount the composites inside pod at /composites:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: run: soadeploy name: soadeploy namespace: soans spec: imagePullSecrets: - name: image-secret containers: - image: soasuite:12.2.1.4 name: soadeploy env: - name: M2_HOME value: /u01/oracle/oracle_common/modules/org.apache.maven_3.2.5 command: [\u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; $HOME/.bashrc; sleep infinity\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - name: mycomposite mountPath: /composites volumes: - name: mycomposite persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soadeploy-pvc   Create the pod:\n$ kubectl apply -f soadeploy.yaml   Once the Kubernetes pod is deployed, exec into the pod to perform Maven/Ant based build and deploy:\n$ kubectl exec -it -n soans soadeploy -- bash   Maven based build and deploy  Note: Make sure to execute these commands inside the soadeploy pod.\n Set up proxy details for Maven to pull dependencies from the internet.\nIf your environment is not running behind a proxy, then skip this step.

	"description": "Upgrade the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator release to a newer version.",
	"content": "To upgrade the WebLogic Kubernetes operator, use the helm upgrade command with new Helm chart and operator image. See the steps here to pull the operator image and set up the Oracle SOA Suite repository that contains the operator chart. To upgrade the operator run the following command:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade \\ --reuse-values \\ --set image=ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:4.1.4 \\ --namespace weblogic-operator-namespace \\ --wait \\ weblogic-kubernetes-operator \\ charts/weblogic-operator  Note: When the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is upgraded from release version 3.2.1 to 3.3.0 or later, it may be expected that the Administration Server pod in the domain gets restarted.\n Post upgrade steps When you upgrade a 3.x operator to 4.0, the upgrade process creates a WebLogic Domain resource conversion webhook deployment and its associated resources in the same namespace. If the conversion webhook deployment already exists in another namespace, then a new conversion webhook deployment is not created. The webhook automatically and transparently upgrades the existing WebLogic Domains from the 3.x schema to the 4.0 schema. For more information, see WebLogic Domain resource conversion webhook.\nIf you have a single WebLogic Kubernetes Operator per Kubernetes cluster (most common use case), you can upgrade directly from any 3.x operator release to 4.1.4. The Helm chart for 4.1.4 automatically installs the schema conversion webhook.\nIf there is more than one WebLogic Kubernetes Operator in a single Kubernetes cluster:\n You must upgrade every operator to at least version 3.4.1 before upgrading any operator to 4.0.0. As the 4.0.x Helm chart also installs a singleton schema conversion webhook that is shared by all 4.0.x operators in the cluster, use the webhookOnly Helm chart option to install this webhook in its own namespace prior to installing any of the 4.0.0 operators, and also use the preserveWebhook Helm chart option with each operator to prevent an operator uninstall from uninstalling the shared webhook. The operator provides a utility that can be used to convert existing “v8” Domain YAML files to “v9”. Several Helm chart default values have been changed. If you upgrade 3.x installations using the --reuse-values option during the Helm upgrade, the installations will continue to use the values from their original installation.  If you are still using an older operator version (from 3.1.1) the T3 channel Kubernetes service name extension is changed from -external to -ext. If the Administration Server was configured to expose a T3 channel in your domain, then follow these steps to recreate the Kubernetes service (for T3 channel) with the new name -ext.\n Note: If these steps are not performed, then the domain restart using spec.serverStartPolicy fails to bring up the servers.\n   Get the existing Kubernetes service name for the T3 channel from the domain namespace. For example, if the domainUID is soainfra, and the Administration Server name is adminserver, then the service is:\nsoainfra-adminserver-external   Delete the existing Kubernetes service for T3 channel, so that operator 3.1.1 creates a new one:\n$ kubectl delete service \u0026lt;T3 channel service\u0026gt; --namespace \u0026lt;domain-namespace\u0026gt; For example, if the domainUID is soainfra, the Administration Server name is adminserver and domain namespace is soans, then the command is:\n$ kubectl delete service soainfra-adminserver-external --namespace soans   Now, the operator automatically creates a new Kubernetes service with -ext instead of -external:\nsoainfra-adminserver-ext "

	"content": "Review the latest changes and known issues for Oracle Access Management on Kubernetes.\nRecent changes    Date Version Change     November, 2023 23.4.2 Supports Oracle Access Management 12.2.1.4 domain deployment using the October 2023 container image which contains the October Patch Set Update (PSU) and other fixes released with the Critical Patch Update (CPU) program.     This release contains the following changes:     Support for creation of OAM domains using Weblogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) Models. See Create OAM domains Using WDT Models.     If currently on October 23 (23.4.1) there is no need to upgrade as the November 23 (23.4.2) release only adds the ability to create new OAM domains using WDT.     If upgrading to November 23 (23.4.2) from October 22 (22.4.1) or later, you must upgrade the following in order:     1. WebLogic Kubernetes Operator to 4.1.2     2. Patch the OAM container image to October 23     If upgrading to November 23 (23.4.2) from a release prior to October 22 (22.4.1), you must upgrade the following in order:     1. WebLogic Kubernetes Operator to 4.1.2     2. Patch the OAM container image to October 23     3. Upgrade the Ingress     4. Upgrade Elasticsearch and Kibana     See Patch and Upgrade for these instructions.   October, 2023 23.4.1 Supports Oracle Access Management 12.2.1.4 domain deployment using the October 2023 container image which contains the October Patch Set Update (PSU) and other fixes released with the Critical Patch Update (CPU) program.     This release contains the following changes:     + Support for WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.1.2.     + Ability to set resource requests and limits for CPU and memory on a cluster resource. See, Set the OAM server memory parameters.     + Support for the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). See, Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.     + The default domain now only starts one OAM Managed Server (oam_server1) and one Policy Managed Server (policy_mgr1).

	"content": "The SOA deployment scripts demonstrate the creation of an Oracle SOA Suite domain home on an existing Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC). The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, complete the following steps:\n Review the Domain resource documentation. Review the requirements and limitations. Ensure that you have executed all the preliminary steps in Prepare your environment. Ensure that the database and the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator are running.  Prepare to use the create domain script The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain.\nYou must edit create-domain-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain. Refer to the configuration parameters below to understand the information that you must provide in this file.\nConfiguration parameters The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     sslEnabled Boolean value that indicates whether SSL must be enabled for each WebLogic Server instance. To enable end-to-end SSL access during load balancer setup, set sslEnabled to true and also, set appropriate value for the javaOptions property as detailed in this table. false   adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminServerSSLPort SSL port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7002   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   soaClusterName Name of the SOA WebLogic Server cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default, the cluster name is soa_cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. soa_cluster   osbClusterName Name of the Oracle Service Bus WebLogic Server cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default, the cluster name is osb_cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. osb_cluster   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic Server domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName parameter. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic Server domain. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified by the createDomainScriptName parameter) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic Server domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified by the createDomainScriptsMountPath parameter. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-in scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the SOA domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/soainfra   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic Server domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. soainfra   domainType Type of the domain. Mandatory input for Oracle SOA Suite domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type values: soa (deploys a SOA domain with Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)), osb (deploys an Oracle Service Bus domain), and soaosb (deploys a domain with SOA, Oracle Service Bus, and Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)). soa   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean value indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean value indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. false   httpAccessLogInLogHome Boolean value indicating if server HTTP access log files should be written to the same directory as logHome. If false, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory specified in the WebLogic Server domain home configuration. true   image SOA Suite Docker image. The operator requires Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4. Refer to Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image for details on how to obtain or create the image. soasuite:12.2.1.4   imagePullPolicy Oracle SOA Suite Docker image pull policy. Valid values are IfNotPresent, Always, Never. IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean value indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 1   javaOptions Java options for initiating the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following predefined variables to obtain WebLogic Server domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). If sslEnabled is set to true, add -Dweblogic.ssl.Enabled=true -Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true to allow the Managed Servers to connect to the Administration Server while booting up. In this environment, the demo certificate generated by the WebLogic Server contains a host name that is different from the runtime container\u0026rsquo;s host name. -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/soainfra   soaManagedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names in the SOA cluster. The default value is soa_server. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. soa_server   osbManagedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names in the Oracle Service Bus cluster. The default value is osb_server. This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. osb_server   soaManagedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server in the SOA cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. 8001   osbManagedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server in the Oracle Service Bus cluster.

This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. 9002   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. soans   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. soainfra-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean value indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Valid values are Never, IfNeeded, or AdminOnly. IfNeeded   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster.   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. soainfra-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database. For example SOA1. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. SOA1   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. soainfra-rcu-credentials   persistentStore The persistent store for \u0026lsquo;JMS servers\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Transaction log store\u0026rsquo; in the domain. Valid values are jdbc, file. jdbc    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, soaClusterName, and soaManagedServerNameBase etc. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an Oracle SOA Suite domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for the domain. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ ./create-domain.sh \\ -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \\ -o \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; The script will perform the following steps:\n Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist. The path name is \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before using this script. Create a Kubernetes job that will start up a utility Oracle SOA Suite container and run offline WLST scripts to create the domain on the shared storage. Run and wait for the job to finish. Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, domain.yaml, in the \u0026ldquo;output\u0026rdquo; directory that was created above. Create a convenient utility script, delete-domain-job.yaml, to clean up the domain home created by the create script.

A configured cluster named soa_cluster of size 5. Managed Server, named soa_server1 listening on port 8001. Log files that are located in /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. SOA Infra, SOA Composer, and WorklistApp applications deployed.  Refer to the troubleshooting page to troubleshoot issues during the domain creation.\n Verify the results The create domain script verifies that the domain was created, and reports failure if there is an error. However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.\nGenerated YAML files with the default inputs   Click here to see sample content of the generated `domain.yaml` for `soaosb` domainType that creates SOA and Oracle Service Bus clusters.   $ cat output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml # Copyright (c) 2020, 2023, Oracle and/or its affiliates. # Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl. # # This is an example of how to define a Domain resource. # apiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v9\u0026quot; kind: Domain metadata: name: soainfra namespace: soans labels: weblogic.domainUID: soainfra spec: # The WebLogic Domain Home domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/soainfra # The domain home source type # Set to PersistentVolume for domain-in-pv, Image for domain-in-image, or FromModel for model-in-image domainHomeSourceType: PersistentVolume # The WebLogic Server image that the Operator uses to start the domain image: \u0026quot;soasuite:12.2.1.4\u0026quot; # imagePullPolicy defaults to \u0026quot;Always\u0026quot; if image version is :latest imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent # Identify which secret contains the credentials for pulling an image #imagePullSecrets: #- name: # Identify which secret contains the WebLogic Admin credentials (note that there is an example of # how to create that secret at the end of this topic) webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: soainfra-domain-credentials # Whether to include the server out file into the pod's stdout, default is true includeServerOutInPodLog: true # Whether to enable log home logHomeEnabled: true # Whether to write HTTP access log file to log home httpAccessLogInLogHome: true # The in-pod location for domain log, server logs, server out, introspector out, and Node Manager log files logHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/soainfra # An (optional) in-pod location for data storage of default and custom file stores. # If not specified or the value is either not set or empty (e.g. dataHome: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) then the # data storage directories are determined from the WebLogic domain home configuration. dataHome: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; # serverStartPolicy legal values are \u0026quot;Never\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IfNeeded\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;AdminOnly\u0026quot; # This determines which WebLogic Servers the Operator will start up when it discovers this Domain # - \u0026quot;Never\u0026quot; will not start any server in the domain # - \u0026quot;AdminOnly\u0026quot; will start up only the administration server (no managed servers will be started) # - \u0026quot;IfNeeded\u0026quot; will start all non-clustered servers, including the administration server and clustered servers up to the replica count serverStartPolicy: IfNeeded serverPod: # an (optional) list of environment variable to be set on the servers env: - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: \u0026quot;-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false\u0026quot; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms256m -Xmx1024m \u0026quot; volumes: - name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soainfra-domain-pvc volumeMounts: - mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume # adminServer is used to configure the desired behavior for starting the administration server. adminServer: # adminService: # channels: # The Admin Server's NodePort # - channelName: default # nodePort: 30701 # Uncomment to export the T3Channel as a service # - channelName: T3Channel # References to Cluster resources that describe the lifecycle options for all # the Managed Server members of a WebLogic cluster, including Java # options, environment variables, additional Pod content, and the ability to # explicitly start, stop, or restart cluster members.

	"description": "Create and configure custom SSL certificates for Oracle SOA Suite domains.",
	"content": "Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides a secured communication for data sent over unsecured networks. In an SSL termination scenario, you can configure SSL between the client browser and the load balancer in your Oracle SOA Suite instance to ensure that applications are accessed securely. In an SSL end-to-end scenario, an Oracle SOA Suite domain is configured to use a self-signed SSL certificate that was generated during domain creation. Clients will typically receive a message indicating that the signing CA for the certificate is unknown and not trusted.\nThis section provides details on how to create and configure custom (CA-issued) SSL certificates for Oracle SOA Suite domains in both SSL end-to-end and SSL termination scenarios.\n Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL end-to-end scenario Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL termination at a load balancer  Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL end-to-end scenario These steps describe how to replace the identity and trust keystore of an Oracle SOA Suite domain with a custom identity and custom trust keystore and register with digital certificates procured from any third party authority.\nIn this documentation, the registered domain is mydomain.com and the CA signed certificates are taken from mydomain.\nCreate a custom identity and custom trust keystore and generate a certificate signing request (CSR) To create a custom identity and custom trust keystore and generate a CSR:\n  Log in to the Enterprise Manager (EM) Console and access the Keystores page by opening WebLogic Domain \u0026gt; Security \u0026gt; Keystore.\n  Under the system stripe, click Create Keystore to create a new keystore.\n  Provide the following details for custom identity:\nKeystore Name: custIdentity Protection: Select the Password option. Keystore Password: Enter the password. Confirm Password: Confirm the password.\n  Click Create Keystore to create another new keystore.\n  Provide the following details for custom trust:\n Keystore Name: custTrust Protection: Select the Password option. Keystore Password: Enter the password. Confirm Password: Confirm the password.    Click Manage on the custIdentity keystore name and provide the password that you specified previously.\n  Click Generate Keypair to create a new key pair, and provide the following details for custIdentity with alias as custIdentity and password:\n Alias Name: custIdentity Common Name: Common name, for example, soak8s.mydomain.com (Registered domain name) Organizational Unit: Name of the organizational unit Organization: Organization name Enter City, State, and Country names Key Type: RSA Key Size: 2048 Password: Enter the password    Click OK to generate the keypair.\n  Select the newly created keypair and click Generate CSR.\n  Export the created CSR, share it with Certificate Authority, such as digicert CA, and get root, intermediate, and signed certificates. The certificate is generated for the domain name you used in the Common Name field.\n  It is not mandatory to create identity and trust keystore under the system stripe that comes with default provisioning. You can create a new custom stripe and create identity and trust keystores under it.\nShare the CSR with CA to get CA-signed certificates   Select the new keypair under the custIdentity and click Generate CSR.\n  Export the created CSR and share it with the Certificate Authority and get root, intermediate, and signed certificates. The certificate is generated for the domain name you used in the Common Name field.\n  Download the certificates shared in the zip file from the CA. The zip file contains one of the following:\n the three certificates individually - root, intermediate, and signed certificates root and intermediate certificates in one chain and signed certificate separately    Double-click the certificate chain for root and intermediate certificates. You can see the full chain when you click on the certification path.\n  Extract the root and intermediate certificates individually by going to the certification path, select the certificate to be extracted (root or intermediate) and click View Certificate.\n  On the View Certificates pop-up, select the Details tab and click Copy to File.\n  In the Certificate Export wizard, click Next, then select Base 64 encoded X.509 (CER), and then click Next. Export the certificate.\n  Name the exported certificate as root and intermediate certificates respectively.\n  Import CA certificates Certificate Authority (CA) certificates must be imported in the following order: first the signed server certificate, then the intermediate certificate, and then the root certificate.\nTo import CA certificates:\n  Use WLST commands to import the certificate chain in the identity keystore (custIdentity):\na. Combine the three certificates into a single text file called chain.pem in the following order: signed server certificate, followed by intermediate certificate, followed by root certificate:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;signed server certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;intermediate certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;root certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- b. Place the chain.pem in /tmp from where you will be executing the kubectl commands (for example, on the master node).\nc. Enter the following command to change the file ownership to 1000:1000 user/group:\n$ sudo chown 1000:1000 /tmp/chain.pem d. Copy /tmp/chain.pem into the Administration Server pod (for example, soainfra-adminserver):\n$ kubectl cp /tmp/chain.pem soans/soainfra-adminserver:/tmp/chain.pem e. Exec into the Administration Server pod to perform all operations:\n$ kubectl exec -it soainfra-adminserver -n soans -- bash f. Start WLST and access the Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) key store service:\n$ cd /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/ $ ./wlst.sh : : wls:/offline\u0026gt; connect(\u0026quot;weblogic\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Welcome1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;t3://soainfra-adminserver:7001\u0026quot;) : : wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc = getOpssService(name='KeyStoreService') g. Use the WLST importKeyStoreCertificate command to import chain.pem:\nsvc.importKeyStoreCertificate(appStripe='stripe', name='keystore', password='password', alias='alias', keypassword='keypassword', type='entrytype',filepath='absolute_file_path') For example:\nwls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.importKeyStoreCertificate(appStripe='system', name='custIdentity', password=welcome1, alias='custIdentity', keypassword='welcome1', type='CertificateChain', filepath='/tmp/chain.pem') e. Exit WLST:\nexit()   Use Oracle Enterprise Manager to import the certificate chain into the trust keystore (custTrust):\na. Log in to the Enterprise Manager Console and access the Keystores page by opening WebLogic domain \u0026gt; Security \u0026gt; Keystore.\nb. Select the trust keystore (custTrust) and click Manage.\nc. Click Import Certificate and import the certificates in this order:\n  the signed server certificate as a trusted certificate (alias mySignedCert)\n  the intermediate certificate from CA as a trusted certificate (alias myInterCA)\n  the root certificate from CA as a trusted certificate (alias myRootCA)\n    Synchronize the local keystore with the security store Synchronize keystores to synchronize information between the domain home and the Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) store in the database.\nTo synchronize keystores:\n Exec into the Administration server pod (for example, soainfra-adminserver): $ kubectl exec -it soainfra-adminserver -n soans -- bash  Start WLST and access the Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) keystore service: $ cd /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/ $ ./wlst.sh : : wls:/offline\u0026gt; connect(\u0026quot;weblogic\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Welcome1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;t3://soainfra-adminserver:7001\u0026quot;) : : wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc = getOpssService(name='KeyStoreService')  Enter the following commands to synchronize the custom identity and custom trust keystores:  Note: This step is necessary only if you are using the system stripe. You do not need to synchronize the keystores if you are using a custom stripe.\n wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.listKeyStoreAliases(appStripe=\u0026quot;system\u0026quot;, name=\u0026quot;custIdentity\u0026quot;, password=\u0026quot; ****\u0026quot;, type=\u0026quot;*\u0026quot;) wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; syncKeyStores(appStripe='system',keystoreFormat='KSS') wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.listKeyStoreAliases (appStripe=\u0026quot;system\u0026quot;, name=\u0026quot;myKSSTrust\u0026quot;, password=\u0026quot;****\u0026quot;, type=\u0026quot;*\u0026quot;) wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; syncKeyStores(appStripe='system',keystoreFormat='KSS')   Update the WebLogic keystores with custom identity and trust To update the WebLogic keystores with custom identity and custom trust:\n  In the WebLogic Server Administration Console, open Servers \u0026gt; AdminServer \u0026gt; Configurations \u0026gt; Keystores tab.\n  Change the Keystores to Custom Identity and Custom Trust and Save.\n  Provide the values for Custom Identity:\n Custom Identity Keystore: kss://system/custidentity Custom Identity KeyStore Type: KSS Custom Identity PassPhrase: enter password given while creating the custIdentity keystore. Confirm Custom Identity PassPhrase: reenter the password.    Provide the values for Custom Trust:\n Custom Trust Keystore: kss://system/custTrust Custom Trust KeyStore Type: KSS Custom Trust PassPhrase: enter password given while creating the custTrust keystore. Confirm Custom Trust PassPhrase: reenter the password.    Click Save and then Activate changes.\n  Open the SSL tab and provide the following details:\n Private Key Alias: custIdentity (this is the alias given while creating the key pair in the custIdentity keystore.) Private Key PassPhrase: enter password given while creating the key pair under the custIdentity keystore. Confirm Private Key PassPhrase: reenter the password.    In the Advanced section, change Hostname Verification to None. Click Save and Activate changes.\n  Repeat steps 1 to 7 for all Managed Servers.\n  Restart the domain.\n  Once the servers are up and running, you can check if the SSL URLs show the updated certificates.\n  For more details, refer to:\n Administering Oracle SOA Cloud Service Administering Oracle Fusion Middleware  Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL termination at a load balancer This section provides references to configure a custom SSL certificate at a load balancer.\nThere are multiple CA vendors in the marketplace today, each offering different levels of service at varying price points. Research and choose a CA vendor that meets your service-level and budget requirements.\nFor a CA vendor to issue you a CA-issued SSL certificate, you must provide the following information:\n Your custom domain name. Public information associated with the domain confirming you as the owner. Email address associated with the custom domain for verification.  Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for your load balancer and submit the CSR to the CA vendor. After receiving the CA-issued certificate, refer to Administering Oracle SOA Cloud Service to import the CA-issued SSL certificate to the load balancer. If you are using openssl to create the certificates, you can refer to Manually Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Using OpenSSL to submit the CSR to the CA vendor.\n"

Currently the operator supports these domain types:\n soa : Deploys a SOA domain with Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS) osb : Deploys an Oracle Service Bus domain soaosb : Deploys a domain with SOA, Oracle Service Bus, and Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)  In this release, Oracle SOA Suite domains are supported using the “domain on a persistent volume” model only, where the domain home is located in a persistent volume (PV).\nThe operator has several key features to assist you with deploying and managing Oracle SOA Suite domains in a Kubernetes environment. You can:\n Create Oracle SOA Suite instances in a Kubernetes persistent volume (PV). This PV can reside in an NFS file system or other Kubernetes volume types. Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states. Expose the Oracle SOA Suite services and composites for external access. Scale Oracle SOA Suite domains by starting and stopping Managed Servers on demand, or by integrating with a REST API. Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs to Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana. Monitor the Oracle SOA Suite instance using Prometheus and Grafana.  Current production release The current production release for the Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment on Kubernetes is 23.4.2. This release uses the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.1.4.\nRecent changes and known issues See the Release Notes for recent changes and known issues for Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment on Kubernetes.\nPricing and licensing See here for pricing and licensing details.\nLimitations See here for limitations in this release.\nAbout this documentation This documentation includes sections targeted to different audiences.

For more details on WebLogic Monitoring Exporter, see here.\nPublish WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch WebLogic Server logs can be published to Elasticsearch using Fluentd. See Fluentd configuration steps.\nPublish SOA server diagnostics logs into Elasticsearch This section shows you how to publish diagnostics logs to Elasticsearch and view them in Kibana. For publishing operator logs, see this sample.\nPrerequisites If you have not already set up Elasticsearch and Kibana for logs collection, refer to this document and complete the setup.\nPublish to Elasticsearch The diagnostics or other logs can be pushed to Elasticsearch server using logstash pod. The logstash pod should have access to the shared domain home or the log location. In case of the Oracle SOA Suite domain, the persistent volume of the domain home can be used in the logstash pod. To create the logstash pod, follow these steps:\n  Get the domain home persistence volume claim details of the domain home of the Oracle SOA Suite domain. The following command lists the persistent volume claim details in the namespace - soans. In the example below, the persistent volume claim is soainfra-domain-pvc:\n$ kubectl get pvc -n soans Sample output:\nNAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE soainfra-domain-pvc Bound soainfra-domain-pv 10Gi RWX soainfra-domain-storage-class xxd   Create the logstash configuration file (logstash.conf). Below is a sample logstash configuration to push diagnostic logs of all servers available at DOMAIN_HOME/servers/\u0026lt;server_name\u0026gt;/logs/-diagnostic.log:\ninput { file { path =\u0026gt; \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/soainfra/servers/**/logs/*-diagnostic.log\u0026quot; start_position =\u0026gt; beginning } } filter { grok { match =\u0026gt; [ \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt;%{DATA:log_timestamp}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{WORD:log_level}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{WORD:thread}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{HOSTNAME:hostname}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{HOSTNAME:servername}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:timer}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;%{DATA:kernel}\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:uuid}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{NUMBER:timestamp}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:misc}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:log_number}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:log_message}\u0026gt;\u0026quot; ] } } output { elasticsearch { hosts =\u0026gt; [\u0026quot;elasticsearch.default.svc.cluster.local:9200\u0026quot;] } }   Copy the logstash.conf into /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains so that it can be used for logstash deployment, using the Administration Server pod (for example soainfra-adminserver pod in namespace soans):\n$ kubectl cp logstash.conf soans/soainfra-adminserver:/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains --namespace soans   Create a deployment YAML (logstash.yaml) for the logstash pod using the domain home persistence volume claim. Make sure to point the logstash configuration file to the correct location (for example, copy logstash.conf to /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logstash.conf) and also the correct domain home persistence volume claim. Below is a sample logstash deployment YAML:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: logstash-soa namespace: soans spec: selector: matchLabels: app: logstash-soa template: # create pods using pod definition in this template metadata: labels: app: logstash-soa spec: volumes: - name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soainfra-domain-pvc - name: shared-logs emptyDir: {} containers: - name: logstash image: logstash:6.6.0 command: [\u0026quot;/bin/sh\u0026quot;] args: [\u0026quot;/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logstash.conf\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume - name: shared-logs mountPath: /shared-logs ports: - containerPort: 5044 name: logstash   Deploy logstash to start publish logs to Elasticsearch:\n$ kubectl create -f logstash.yaml   Now, you can view the diagnostics logs using Kibana with index pattern \u0026ldquo;logstash-*\u0026rdquo;.\n  "

A Kubernetes persistent volume is an arbitrary name (determined in this case, by Oracle) that is mapped to a physical volume on a disk.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\nTo create a Kubernetes persistent volume, perform the following steps:\n  Make a backup copy of the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and create required directories:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Navigate to $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc and edit the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and update the following parameters to reflect your settings. Save the file when complete:\nbaseName: \u0026lt;domain\u0026gt; domainUID: \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; namespace: \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; weblogicDomainStorageType: NFS weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer: \u0026lt;nfs_server\u0026gt;

Create a Kubernetes persistent volume and persistent volume claim\n  Check the Kubernetes cluster is ready As per the Prerequisites a Kubernetes cluster should have already been configured.\n  Run the following command on the master node to check the cluster and worker nodes are running:\n$ kubectl get nodes,pods -n kube-system The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION node/worker-node1 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 17h v1.26.6+1.el8 node/worker-node2 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 17h v1.26.6+1.el8 node/master-node Ready master 23h v1.26.6+1.el8 NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/coredns-66bff467f8-fnhbq 1/1 Running 0 23h pod/coredns-66bff467f8-xtc8k 1/1 Running 0 23h pod/etcd-master 1/1 Running 0 21h pod/kube-apiserver-master-node 1/1 Running 0 21h pod/kube-controller-manager-master-node 1/1 Running 0 21h pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-lxsfw 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-pqrqr 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-wj5nh 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-proxy-2kxv2 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-proxy-82vvj 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-proxy-nrgw9 1/1 Running 0 23h pod/kube-scheduler-master 1/1 Running 0 21h   Obtain the OIG container image The OIG Kubernetes deployment requires access to an OIG container image. The image can be obtained in the following ways:\n Prebuilt OIG container image Build your own OIG container image using WebLogic Image Tool  Prebuilt OIG container image The latest prebuilt OIG October 2023 container image can be downloaded from Oracle Container Registry. This image is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle Identity Governance 12.2.1.4.0, the October Patch Set Update (PSU) and other fixes released with the Critical Patch Update (CPU) program..\nNote: Before using this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oig_cpu and accept the license agreement.\nYou can use this image in the following ways:\n Pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry automatically during the OIG Kubernetes deployment. Manually pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry and then upload it to your own container registry. Manually pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry and manually stage it on the master node and each worker node.  Build your own OIG container image using WebLogic Image Tool You can build your own OIG container image using the WebLogic Image Tool. This is recommended if you need to apply one off patches to a Prebuilt OIG container image. For more information about building your own container image with WebLogic Image Tool, see Create or update image.\nYou can use an image built with WebLogic Image Tool in the following ways:\n Manually upload them to your own container registry. Manually stage them on the master node and each worker node.  Note: This documentation does not tell you how to pull or push the above images into a private container registry, or stage them on the master and worker nodes. Details of this can be found in the Enterprise Deployment Guide.\nSetup the code repository to deploy OIG domains Oracle Identity Governance domain deployment on Kubernetes leverages the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator infrastructure. For deploying the OIG domains, you need to set up the deployment scripts on the master node as below:\n  Create a working directory to setup the source code.\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/OIGK8S   Download the latest OIG deployment scripts from the OIG repository.\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git For example:\n$ cd /scratch/OIGK8S $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git   Set the $WORKDIR environment variable as follows:\n$ export WORKDIR=\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance For example:\n$ export WORKDIR=/scratch/OIGK8S/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance   Run the following command and see if the WebLogic custom resource definition name already exists:\n$ kubectl get crd In the output you should see:\nNo resources found in default namespace. If you see any of the following:\nNAME AGE clusters.weblogic.oracle 5d domains.weblogic.oracle 5d then run the following command to delete the existing crd\u0026rsquo;s:\n$ kubectl delete crd clusters.weblogic.oracle $ kubectl delete crd domains.weblogic.oracle   Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator   On the master node run the following command to create a namespace for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/opns created   Create a service account for the operator in the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace by running the following command:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-sa\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/op-sa created   Run the following helm command to install and start the operator:\n$ cd $WORKDIR $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; \\ --set image=ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:4.1.2 \\ --set serviceAccount=\u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-sa\u0026gt; \\ --set “enableClusterRoleBinding=true” \\ --set \u0026#34;domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy=LabelSelector\u0026#34;

Status: Active No resource quota. No LimitRange resource.   Create a Kubernetes secret for the container registry In this section you create a secret that stores the credentials for the container registry where the OIG image is stored.\nIf you are not using a container registry and have loaded the images on each of the master and worker nodes, then there is no need to create the registry secret.\n  Run the following command to create the secret:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026lt;CONTAINER_REGISTRY\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;EMAIL_ID\u0026gt; \\ --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example, if using Oracle Container Registry:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;user@example.com\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oigns Replace \u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; with the credentials for the registry with the following caveats:\n  If using Oracle Container Registry to pull the OIG container image, this is the username and password used to login to Oracle Container Registry. Before you can use this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oig_cpu and accept the license agreement.\n  If using your own container registry to store the OIG container image, this is the username and password (or token) for your container registry.\n  The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/orclcred created   RCU schema creation In this section you create the RCU schemas in the Oracle Database.\nBefore following the steps in this section, make sure that the database and listener are up and running and you can connect to the database via SQL*Plus or other client tool.\n  If using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OIG container image, run the following command to create a helper pod to run RCU:\n$ kubectl run --image=\u0026lt;image_name-from-registry\u0026gt; --image-pull-policy=\u0026#34;IfNotPresent\u0026#34; --overrides=\u0026#39;{\u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spec\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;imagePullSecrets\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34;}]}}\u0026#39; helper -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -- sleep infinity For example:\n$ kubectl run --image=container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October`23\u0026gt; --image-pull-policy=\u0026#34;IfNotPresent\u0026#34; --overrides=\u0026#39;{\u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;spec\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;imagePullSecrets\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34;}]}}\u0026#39; helper -n oigns -- sleep infinity If you are not using a container registry and have loaded the image on each of the master and worker nodes, run the following command:\n$ kubectl run helper --image \u0026lt;image\u0026gt; -n oigns -- sleep infinity For example:\n$ kubectl run helper --image oracle/oig:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October`23\u0026gt; -n oigns -- sleep infinity The output will look similar to the following:\npod/helper created   Run the following command to check the pod is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE helper 1/1 Running 0 3m Note: If you are pulling the image from a container registry it may take several minutes before the pod has a STATUS of 1\\1. While the pod is starting you can check the status of the pod, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl describe pod helper -n oigns   Run the following command to start a bash shell in the helper pod:\n$ kubectl exec -it helper -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -- /bin/bash For example:\n$ kubectl exec -it helper -n oigns -- /bin/bash This will take you into a bash shell in the running helper pod:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$   In the helper bash shell run the following commands to set the environment:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_HOST=\u0026lt;db_host.domain\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_PORT=\u0026lt;db_port\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_SERVICE=\u0026lt;service_name\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCUPREFIX=\u0026lt;rcu_schema_prefix\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCU_SCHEMA_PWD=\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ echo -e \u0026lt;db_pwd\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; \u0026gt; /tmp/pwd.txt [oracle@helper oracle]$ cat /tmp/pwd.txt where:\n\u0026lt;db_host.domain\u0026gt; is the database server hostname\n\u0026lt;db_port\u0026gt; is the database listener port\n\u0026lt;service_name\u0026gt; is the database service name\n\u0026lt;rcu_schema_prefix\u0026gt; is the RCU schema prefix you want to set\n\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; is the password you want to set for the \u0026lt;rcu_schema_prefix\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;db_pwd\u0026gt; is the SYS password for the database\nFor example:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_HOST=mydatabasehost.example.com [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_PORT=1521 [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_SERVICE=orcl.example.com [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCUPREFIX=OIGK8S [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCU_SCHEMA_PWD=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ echo -e \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \u0026gt; /tmp/pwd.txt [oracle@helper oracle]$ cat /tmp/pwd.txt \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;   In the helper bash shell run the following commands to create the RCU schemas in the database:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ /u01/oracle/oracle_common/bin/rcu -silent -createRepository -databaseType ORACLE -connectString \\ $DB_HOST:$DB_PORT/$DB_SERVICE -dbUser sys -dbRole sysdba -useSamePasswordForAllSchemaUsers true \\ -selectDependentsForComponents true -schemaPrefix $RCUPREFIX -component OIM -component MDS -component SOAINFRA -component OPSS \\ -f \u0026lt; /tmp/pwd.txt The output will look similar to the following:\nRCU Logfile: /tmp/RCU\u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt;/logs/rcu.log Processing command line ....

This involves the following steps:\na. Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU\nb. Create a Kubernetes persistent volume and persistent volume claim\nCreating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU   Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain using the create-weblogic-credentials script in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p \u0026lt;pwd\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; where:\n-u weblogic is the WebLogic username\n-p \u0026lt;pwd\u0026gt; is the password for the WebLogic user\n-n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; is the domain namespace\n-d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; is the domain UID to be created. The default is domain1 if not specified\n-s \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; is the name you want to create for the secret for this namespace. The default is to use the domainUID if not specified\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -n oigns -d governancedomain -s oig-domain-credentials The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/oig-domain-credentials created secret/oig-domain-credentials labeled The secret oig-domain-credentials has been successfully created in the oigns namespace.

A Kubernetes persistent volume is an arbitrary name (determined in this case, by Oracle) that is mapped to a physical volume on a disk.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\n  Make a backup copy of the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and create required directories:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv touch file.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Navigate to $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc and edit the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and update the following parameters to reflect your settings. Save the file when complete:\nbaseName: \u0026lt;domain\u0026gt; domainUID: \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; namespace: \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; weblogicDomainStorageType: NFS weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer: \u0026lt;nfs_server\u0026gt;

This is the recommended approach if you have access to the Oracle SOA Suite patches because it optimizes the size of the image.   Use update for patching an existing Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache Set up additional build scripts  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location.  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it. In these steps, this directory is imagetool-setup.\n$ mkdir imagetool-setup $ cd imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file to the imagetool-setup directory.\n  Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool on a Linux environment:\n$ cd imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git   Copy the additional WebLogic Image Tool build files from the operator source repository to the imagetool-setup location:\n$ mkdir -p imagetool-setup/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0 $ cd imagetool-setup/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0 $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/imagetool-scripts/* .    Note: If you want to create the image continue with the following steps, otherwise to update the image see update an image.\n Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool and required build scripts, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle SOA Suite Docker image.\nDownload the Oracle SOA Suite installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle SOA Suite installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice.

Consult the README file for important prerequisite steps, such as building or pulling the Server JRE Docker image, Oracle FMW Infrastructure Docker image, and downloading the Oracle SOA Suite installer and bundle patch binaries.\nA prebuilt Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4, is available at container-registry.oracle.com. We recommend that you pull and rename this image to build the Oracle SOA Suite image.\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 $ docker tag container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.0 Follow these steps to build an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, and then the Oracle SOA Suite image as a layer on top of that:\n  Make a local clone of the sample repository:\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images   Build the oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 image:\n$ cd docker-images/OracleFMWInfrastructure/dockerfiles $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4 -s This will produce an image named oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.\n  Tag the image as follows:\n$ docker tag oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.0   Download the Oracle SOA Suite installer from the Oracle Technology Network or e-delivery.\n Note: Copy the installer binaries to the same location as the Dockerfile.\n   To build the Oracle SOA Suite image with patches, you must download and drop the patch zip files (for example, p29928100_122140_Generic.zip) into the patches/ folder under the version that is required. For example, for 12.2.1.4.0 the folder is 12.2.1.4/patches. Similarly, to build the image by including the OPatch patch, download and drop the OPatch patch zip file (for example, p28186730_1394211_Generic.zip) into the opatch_patch/ folder.\n  Create the Oracle SOA Suite image by running the provided script:\n$ cd docker-images/OracleSOASuite/dockerfiles $ ./buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4 -s The image produced will be named oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4. The samples and instructions assume the Oracle SOA Suite image is named soasuite:12.2.1.4. You must rename your image to match this name, or update the samples to refer to the image you created.\n$ docker tag oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4 soasuite:12.2.1.4   "

	"content": " Oracle strongly recommends that you do not expose non-HTTPS traffic (T3/T3s/LDAP/IIOP/IIOPs) outside of the external firewall. You can control this access using a combination of network channels and firewalls.\n You can create T3/T3S channels and the corresponding Kubernetes service to expose the T3/T3S protocol for the Administration Server and Managed Servers in an Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nThe WebLogic Kubernetes Operator provides an option to expose a T3 channel for the Administration Server using the exposeAdminT3Channel setting during domain creation, then the matching T3 service can be used to connect. By default, when exposeAdminT3Channel is set, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment exposes the NodePort for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint at 30012 (use t3ChannelPort to configure the port to a different value).\nIf you miss enabling exposeAdminT3Channel during domain creation, follow these steps to create a T3 channel for Administration Server manually.\nExpose a T3/T3S Channel for the Administration Server To create a custom T3/T3S channel for the Administration Server that has a listen port listen_port and a paired public port public_port:\n  Create t3_admin_config.py with the following content:\nadmin_pod_name = sys.argv[1] admin_port = sys.argv[2] user_name = sys.argv[3] password = sys.argv[4] listen_port = sys.argv[5] public_port = sys.argv[6] public_address = sys.argv[7] AdminServerName = sys.argv[8] channelType = sys.argv[9] print(\u0026#39;custom admin_pod_name : [%s]\u0026#39;

This step must be followed if using Oracle Container Registry or your own private container registry. If you are not using a container registry and have loaded the images on each of the master and worker nodes, you can skip this step.\n  Run the following command to create the secret:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026lt;CONTAINER_REGISTRY\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;EMAIL_ID\u0026gt; \\ --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example, if using Oracle Container Registry:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;user@example.com\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oudns Replace \u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; with the credentials for the registry with the following caveats:\n  If using Oracle Container Registry to pull the OUD container image, this is the username and password used to login to Oracle Container Registry. Before you can use this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oud_cpu and accept the license agreement.\n  If using your own container registry to store the OUD container image, this is the username and password (or token) for your container registry.\n  The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/orclcred created   Create a Kubernetes secret for cronjob images Once OUD is deployed, if the Kubernetes node where the OUD pod(s) is/are running goes down after the pod eviction time-out, the pod(s) don\u0026rsquo;t get evicted but move to a Terminating state. The pod(s) will then remain in that state forever. To avoid this problem a cron-job is created during OUD deployment that checks for any pods in Terminating state. If there are any pods in Terminating state, the cron job will delete them. The pods will then start again automatically. This cron job requires access to images on hub.docker.com. A Kubernetes secret must therefore be created to enable access to these images.\n  Create a Kubernetes secret to access the required images on hub.docker.com:\nNote: You must first have a user account on hub.docker.com:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;dockercred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026#34;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026#34; --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;docker_username\u0026gt;\u0026#34; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;docker_email_credentials\u0026gt; --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026quot;dockercred\u0026quot; --docker-server=\u0026quot;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026quot; --docker-username=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=user@example.com --namespace=oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/dockercred created   The oud-ds-rs Helm chart The oud-ds-rs Helm chart allows you to create or deploy a group of replicated Oracle Unified Directory instances along with Kubernetes objects in a specified namespace.\nThe deployment can be initiated by running the following Helm command with reference to the oud-ds-rs Helm chart, along with configuration parameters according to your environment.\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm $ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Configuration Parameters\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Helm Chart Path/Name\u0026gt; Configuration Parameters (override values in chart) can be passed on with --set arguments on the command line and/or with -f / --values arguments when referring to files.\nNote: The examples in Create OUD instances below provide values which allow the user to override the default values provided by the Helm chart. A full list of configuration parameters and their default values is shown in Appendix A: Configuration parameters.\nFor more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help.\nCreate OUD instances You can create OUD instances using one of the following methods:\n Using a YAML file Using --set argument  Note: While it is possible to install sample data during the OID deployment is it not possible to load your own data via an ldif file . In order to load data in OUD, create the OUD deployment and then use ldapmodify post the ingress deployment. See Using LDAP utilities.\nUsing a YAML file   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm   Create an oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml as follows:\nimage: repository: \u0026lt;image_location\u0026gt; tag: \u0026lt;image_tag\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred oudConfig: # memory, cpu parameters for both requests and limits for oud instances resources: limits: cpu: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;4Gi\u0026#34; requests: cpu: \u0026#34;500m\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;4Gi\u0026#34; rootUserPassword: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; sampleData: \u0026#34;200\u0026#34; persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oud_user_projects cronJob: kubectlImage: repository: bitnami/kubectl tag: \u0026lt;version\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred For example:\nimage: repository: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oud_cpu tag: 12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October`23\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred oudConfig: # memory, cpu parameters for both requests and limits for oud instances resources: limits: cpu: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;8Gi\u0026#34; requests: cpu: \u0026#34;500m\u0026#34; memory: \u0026#34;4Gi\u0026#34; rootUserPassword: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; sampleData: \u0026#34;200\u0026#34; persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: /scratch/shared/oud_user_projects cronJob: kubectlImage: repository: bitnami/kubectl tag: 1.26.6 pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred The following caveats exist:\n  Replace \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; with the relevant password.\n  sampleData: \u0026quot;200\u0026quot; will load 200 sample users into the default baseDN dc=example,dc=com.

For example if your Kubernetes version is 1.26.6 set to 1.26.6.\n  If you are not using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OUD container image, then you can remove the following:\nimagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred   If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as bitnami/kubectl or busybox, you must load the images in a local container registry. You must then set the following:\ncronJob: kubectlImage: repository: container-registry.example.com/bitnami/kubectl tag: 1.26.6 pullPolicy: IfNotPresent busybox: image: container-registry.example.com/busybox   If using NFS for your persistent volume then change the persistence section as follows:\nNote: If you want to use NFS you should ensure that you have a default Kubernetes storage class defined for your environment that allows network storage.\nFor more information on storage classes, see Storage Classes.\npersistence: type: networkstorage networkstorage: nfs: path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oud_user_projects server: \u0026lt;NFS IP address\u0026gt; # if true, it will create the storageclass. if value is false, please provide existing storage class (storageClass) to be used. storageClassCreate: true storageClass: oud-sc # if storageClassCreate is true, please provide the custom provisioner if any to use. If you do not have a custom provisioner, delete this line, and it will use the default class kubernetes.io/is-default-class. provisioner: kubernetes.io/is-default-class The following caveats exist:\n If you want to create your own storage class, set storageClassCreate: true. If storageClassCreate: true it is recommended to set storageClass to a value of your choice, and provisioner to the provisioner supported by your cloud vendor. If you have an existing storageClass that supports network storage, set storageClassCreate: false and storageClass to the NAME value returned in \u0026ldquo;kubectl get storageclass\u0026rdquo;. The provisioner can be ignored.    If using Block Device storage for your persistent volume then change the persistence section as follows:\nNote: If you want to use block devices you should ensure that you have a default Kubernetes storage class defined for your environment that allows dynamic storage. Each vendor has its own storage provider but it may not be configured to provide dynamic storage allocation.\nFor more information on storage classes, see Storage Classes.\npersistence: type: blockstorage # Specify Accessmode ReadWriteMany for NFS and for block ReadWriteOnce accessMode: ReadWriteOnce # if true, it will create the storageclass. if value is false, please provide existing storage class (storageClass) to be used. storageClassCreate: true storageClass: oud-sc # if storageClassCreate is true, please provide the custom provisioner if any to use or else it will use default. provisioner: oracle.com/oci The following caveats exist:\n If you want to create your own storage class, set storageClassCreate: true. If storageClassCreate: true it is recommended to set storageClass to a value of your choice, and provisioner to the provisioner supported by your cloud vendor. If you have an existing storageClass that supports dynamic storage, set storageClassCreate: false and storageClass to the NAME value returned in \u0026ldquo;kubectl get storageclass\u0026rdquo;. The provisioner can be ignored.    For resources, limits and requests, the example CPU and memory values shown are for development environments only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\n  If you plan on integrating OUD with other Oracle components then you must specify the following under the oudConfig: section:\n integration: \u0026lt;Integration option\u0026gt;  For example: oudConfig: etc... integration: \u0026lt;Integration option\u0026gt;  It is recommended to choose the option covering your minimal requirements.

This step must be followed if using Oracle Container Registry or your own private container registry. If you are not using a container registry and have loaded the images on each of the master and worker nodes, you can skip this step.\n  Run the following command to create the secret:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026lt;CONTAINER_REGISTRY\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;EMAIL_ID\u0026gt; \\ --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example, if using Oracle Container Registry:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;user@example.com\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oudsmns Replace \u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; with the credentials for the registry with the following caveats:\n  If using Oracle Container Registry to pull the OUDSM container image, this is the username and password used to login to Oracle Container Registry. Before you can use this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oudsm_cpu and accept the license agreement.\n  If using your own container registry to store the OUDSM container image, this is the username and password (or token) for your container registry.\n  The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/orclcred created   Create a persistent volume directory As referenced in Prerequisites the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must have access to a persistent volume such as a Network File System (NFS) mount or a shared file system.\nIn this example /scratch/shared/ is a shared directory accessible from all nodes.\n  On the master node run the following command to create a user_projects directory:\n$ cd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt; $ mkdir oudsm_user_projects $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 oudsm_user_projects For example:\n$ cd /scratch/shared $ mkdir oudsm_user_projects $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 oudsm_user_projects   On the master node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\n$ cd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects $ touch file.txt $ ls filemaster.txt For example:\n$ cd /scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects $ touch filemaster.txt $ ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\n$ cd /scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects $ ls filemaster.txt $ touch fileworker1.txt $ ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  The oudsm Helm chart The oudsm Helm chart allows you to create or deploy Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager instances along with Kubernetes objects in a specified namespace.\nThe deployment can be initiated by running the following Helm command with reference to the oudsm Helm chart, along with configuration parameters according to your environment.\ncd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm $ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Configuration Parameters\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Helm Chart Path/Name\u0026gt; Configuration Parameters (override values in chart) can be passed on with --set arguments on the command line and/or with -f / --values arguments when referring to files.\nNote: The examples in Create OUDSM instances below provide values which allow the user to override the default values provided by the Helm chart. A full list of configuration parameters and their default values is shown in Appendix: Configuration parameters.\nFor more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help.\nCreate OUDSM instances You can create OUDSM instances using one of the following methods:\n Using a YAML file Using --set argument  Using a YAML file   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm   Create an oudsm-values-override.yaml as follows:\nimage: repository: \u0026lt;image_location\u0026gt; tag: \u0026lt;image_tag\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred oudsm: adminUser: weblogic adminPass: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects For example:\nimage: repository: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oudsm_cpu tag: 12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October\u0026#39;23\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred oudsm: adminUser: weblogic adminPass: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: /scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects The following caveats exist:\n  Replace \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; with a the relevant passwords.\n  If you are not using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OUD container image, then you can remove the following:\nimagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred   If using NFS for your persistent volume the change the persistence section as follows:\n  persistence: type: networkstorage networkstorage: nfs: path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects server: \u0026lt;NFS IP address\u0026gt;   Run the following command to deploy OUDSM:\n$ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ --values oudsm-values-override.yaml \\ \u0026lt;release_name\u0026gt; oudsm $ helm install --namespace oudsmns \\ --values oudsm-values-override.yaml \\ oudsm oudsm   Check the OUDSM deployment as per Verify the OUDSM deployment\n  Using --set argument   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm   Run the following command to create OUDSM instance:\n$ helm install --namespace oudsmns \\ --set oudsm.adminUser=weblogic,oudsm.adminPass=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;,persistence.filesystem.hostPath.path=\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects,image.repository=\u0026lt;image_location\u0026gt;,image.tag=\u0026lt;image_tag\u0026gt; \\ --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=\u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; \\ \u0026lt;release_name\u0026gt; oudsm For example:\n$ helm install --namespace oudsmns \\ --set oudsm.adminUser=weblogic,oudsm.adminPass=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;,persistence.filesystem.hostPath.path=/scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects,image.repository=container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oudsm_cpu,image.tag=12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October\u0026#39;23\u0026gt; \\ --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=\u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; \\ oudsm oudsm The following caveats exist:\n Replace \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; with a the relevant password.

Using LDAP utilities To use Oracle LDAP utilities such as ldapbind, ldapsearch, ldapmodify etc. you can either:\n  Run the LDAP commands from an OUD installation outside the Kubernetes cluster. This requires access to an On-Premises OUD installation oustide the Kubernetes cluster.\n  Run the LDAP commands from inside the OUD Kubernetes pod.\n$ kubectl exec -ti \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; -- bash For example:\n$ kubectl exec -ti oud-ds-rs-0 -n oudns -- bash This will take you into a bash session in the pod:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ Inside the container navigate to /u01/oracle/oud/bin to view the LDAP utilties:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ cd /u01/oracle/oud/bin [oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 bin]$ ls ldap* ldapcompare ldapdelete ldapmodify ldappasswordmodify ldapsearch Note: For commands that require an ldif file, copy the file into the \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oud_user_projects directory:\n$ cp file.ldif \u0026lt;peristent_volume\u0026gt;/oud_user_projects For example:\n$ cp file.ldif /scratch/shared/oud_user_projects The file can then be viewed inside the pod:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 bin]$ cd /u01/oracle/user_projects [oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 user_projects]$ ls *.ldif file.ldif   Validate access using LDAP Note: The examples assume sample data was installed when creating the OUD instance.\nLDAP against External Load Balancer Note If your ingress is configured with type: LoadBalancer then you cannot connect to the external LoadBalancer hostname and ports from inside the pod and must connect from an OUD installation outside the cluster.\n  Command to perform ldapsearch against External LBR and LDAP port\n$OUD_HOME/bin/ldapsearch --hostname \u0026lt;External LBR\u0026gt;

It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available. You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace mynginx get services -o wide -w lbr-nginx-ingress-nginx-controller' An example Ingress that makes use of the controller: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: example namespace: foo spec: ingressClassName: nginx rules: - host: www.example.com http: paths: - pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: exampleService port: number: 80 path: / # This section is only required if TLS is to be enabled for the Ingress tls: - hosts: - www.example.com secretName: example-tls If TLS is enabled for the Ingress, a Secret containing the certificate and key must also be provided: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: example-tls namespace: foo data: tls.crt: \u0026lt;base64 encoded cert\u0026gt; tls.key: \u0026lt;base64 encoded key\u0026gt; type: kubernetes.io/tls   Access to interfaces through ingress Using the Helm chart, ingress objects are created according to configuration. The following table details the rules configured in ingress object(s) for access to Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Interfaces through ingress.\n   Port NodePort Host Example Hostname Path Backend Service:Port Example Service Name:Port     http/https 30080/30443 \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt;-N oudsm-N * \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt;-N:http oudsm-1:http   http/https 30080/30443 * * /oudsm/console \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt;-lbr:http oudsm-lbr:http     In the table above, the Example Name for each Object is based on the value \u0026lsquo;oudsm\u0026rsquo; as the deployment/release name for the Helm chart installation. The NodePorts mentioned in the table are according to ingress configuration described in previous section. When an External LoadBalancer is not available/configured, interfaces can be accessed through NodePort on the Kubernetes node.  Changes in /etc/hosts to validate hostname based ingress rules If it is not possible to have LoadBalancer configuration updated to have host names added for Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Interfaces, then the following entries can be added in /etc/hosts files on the host from where Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager interfaces would be accessed.\n\u0026lt;IP Address of External LBR or Kubernetes Node\u0026gt;\toudsm oudsm-1 oudsm-2 oudsm-N  In the table above, host names are based on the value \u0026lsquo;oudsm\u0026rsquo; as the deployment/release name for the Helm chart installation. When an External LoadBalancer is not available/configured, Interfaces can be accessed through NodePort on the Kubernetes Node.  Validate OUDSM URL\u0026rsquo;s   Launch a browser and access the OUDSM console.\n If using an External LoadBalancer: https://\u0026lt;External LBR Host\u0026gt;/oudsm. If not using an External LoadBalancer use https://\u0026lt;Kubernetes Node\u0026gt;:30443/oudsm.    Access the WebLogic Administration console by accessing the following URL and login with weblogic/\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; where weblogic/\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; is the adminUser and adminPass set when creating the OUDSM instance.\n If using an External LoadBalancer: https://\u0026lt;External LBR Host\u0026gt;/console. If not using an External LoadBalancer use https://\u0026lt;Kubernetes Node\u0026gt;:30443/console.    "

This location by default will be in ${ORACLE_HOME}/soa/soa which is not under Persistent Volume (PV). Therefore, provide the domain\u0026rsquo;s PV location such as {DOMAIN_HOME}/soainfra/servers.\nNow the Plan.xml will be persisted under this location for each Managed Server.\n  Method 2: Customize the Adapter file on the Worker Node:   Copy ABC.rar from the server pod to a PV path:\n$ kubectl cp \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;SOA Managed Server pod name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;full path of .rar file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;destination path inside PV\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl cp soans/soainfra-soa-server1:/u01/oracle/soa/soa/connectors/ABC.rar ${DockerVolume}/domains/soainfra/servers/ABC.rar or do a normal file copy between these locations after entering (using kubectl exec) in to the Managed Server pod.\n  Unrar ABC.rar.\n  Update the new connection details in the weblogic-ra.xml file under META_INF.\n  In the WebLogic Administration Console, under Deployments, select ABC.rar, then Update.\n  Select the ABC.rar path as the new location, which is ${DOMAIN_HOME}/user_projects/domains/soainfra/servers/ABC.rar and click Update.\n  Verify that the plan.xml or updated .rar should be persisted in the PV.\n  "

	"description": "This section describes known issues for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment on Kubernetes. It also provides answers to frequently asked questions.",
	"content": "Overriding tuning parameters is not supported using configuration overrides The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator enables you to override some of the domain configuration using configuration overrides (also called situational configuration). See supported overrides. Overriding the tuning parameters such as MaxMessageSize and PAYLOAD, for Oracle SOA Suite domains is not supported using the configuration overrides feature. However, you can override them using the following steps:\n  Specify the new value using the environment variable K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES in serverPod.env section in domain.yaml configuration file (example path: \u0026lt;domain-creation-output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml) based on the servers to which the changes are to be applied.\nFor example, to override the value at the Administration Server pod level:\nspec: adminServer: serverPod: env: - name: K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES value: \u0026#34;-Dweblogic.MaxMessageSize=78787878\u0026#34; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms512m -Xmx1024m \u0026#39; serverStartState: RUNNING For example, to override the value at a specific cluster level (soa_cluster or osb_cluster):\napiVersion: \u0026#34;weblogic.oracle/v1\u0026#34; kind: Cluster metadata: name: soainfra-soa-cluster # Update this with the namespace your domain will run in: namespace: soans labels: # Update this with the `domainUID` of your domain: weblogic.domainUID: soainfra spec: clusterName: soa_cluster serverService: precreateService: true serverPod: env: - name: K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES value: \u0026#34;-Dsoa.payload.threshold.kb=102410\u0026#34;  Note: When multiple system properties are specified for serverPod.env.value, make sure each system property is separated by a space.\n   Apply the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: The server pod(s) will be automatically restarted (rolling restart).\n   Deployments in the WebLogic Server Administration Console may display unexpected error In an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using the operator, accessing Deployments from the WebLogic Server Administration Console home page may display the error message Unexpected error encountered while obtaining monitoring information for applications. This error does not have any functional impact and can be ignored. You can verify that the applications are in Active state from the Control tab in Summary of deployments page.\nEnterprise Manager Console may display ADF_FACES-30200 error In an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using the operator, the Enterprise Manager Console may intermittently display the following error when the domain servers are restarted:\nADF_FACES-30200: For more information, please see the server\u0026#39;s error log for an entry beginning with: The UIViewRoot is null. Fatal exception during PhaseId: RESTORE_VIEW 1. You can refresh the Enterprise Manager Console URL to successfully log in to the Console.\nConfigure the external URL access for Oracle SOA Suite composite applications For Oracle SOA Suite composite applications to access the external URLs over the internet (if your cluster is behind a http proxy server), you must configure the following proxy parameters for Administration Server and Managed Server pods.\n-Dhttp.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttps.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\u0026#34;localhost|soainfra-adminserver|soainfra-soa-server1|soainfra-osb-server1|...soainfra-soa-serverN|*.svc.cluster.local|*.your.domain.com|/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; To do this, edit the domain.yaml configuration file and append the proxy parameters to the spec.serverPod.env.JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable value.\nFor example:\nserverPod: env: - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false -Dweblogic.ssl.Enabled=true -Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true -Dhttp.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttps.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\u0026#34;localhost|soainfra-adminserver|soainfra-soa-server1|soainfra-osb-server1|...soainfra-soa-serverN|*.svc.cluster.local|*.your.domain.com|/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms256m -Xmx1024m \u0026#39; volumeMounts:  Note: The -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts parameter must have the pod names of the Administration Server and each Managed Server. For example: soainfra-adminserver, soainfra-soa-server1, soainfra-osb-server1, and so on.\n Apply the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: The server pod(s) will be automatically restarted (rolling restart).\n Configure the external access for the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler WebServices WSDL URLs In an Oracle SOA Suite domain deployed including the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS) component, the following ESS WebServices WSDL URLs shown in the table format in the ess/essWebServicesWsdl.jsp page are not reachable outside the Kubernetes cluster.\nESSWebService EssAsyncCallbackService EssWsJobAsyncCallbackService Follow these steps to configure the external access for the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler WebServices WSDL URLs:\n Log in to the Administration Console URL of the domain.\nFor example: http://\u0026lt;LOADBALANCER-HOST\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/console In the Home Page, click Clusters. Then click the soa_cluster. Click the HTTP tab and then click Lock \u0026amp; Edit in the Change Center panel. Update the following values:  Frontend Host: host name of the load balancer. For example, domain1.example.com. Frontend HTTP Port: load balancer port. For example, 30305. Frontend HTTPS Port: load balancer https port. For example, 30443.   Click Save. Click Activate Changes in the Change Center panel. Restart the servers in the SOA cluster.   Note: Do not restart servers from the Administration Console.\n Missing gif images in Oracle Service Bus console pipeline configuration page In an Oracle SOA Suite domain environment upgraded to the release 21.1.2, some gif images are not rendered in the Oracle Serice Bus console pipeline configuration page, as their corresponding url paths are not exposed via the Ingress path rules in the earlier releases (for Non-SSL and SSL termination). To resolve this issue, perform the following steps to apply the latest ingress configuration:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade \u0026lt;helm_release_for_ingress\u0026gt; \\ charts/ingress-per-domain \\ --namespace \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; \\ --reuse-values  Note: helm_release_for_ingress is the ingress name used in the corresponding helm install command for the ingress installation.\n For example, to upgrade the NGINX based ingress configuration:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade soa-nginx-ingress \\ charts/ingress-per-domain \\ --namespace soans \\ --reuse-values WebLogic Kubernetes Operator FAQs See the general frequently asked questions for using the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\n"

Obtain the certificate from the Administration Server to be used for a secured (t3s) connection from the client by exporting the certificate from the Administration Server using WLST commands. Sample commands to export the default demoidentity:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin [oracle@helper bin]$ ./wlst.sh . . wls:/offline\u0026gt; connect('weblogic','\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;','t3://soainfra-adminserver:7001') . . wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc = getOpssService(name='KeyStoreService') wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.exportKeyStoreCertificate(appStripe='system', name='demoidentity', password='DemoIdentityKeyStorePassPhrase', alias='DemoIdetityKeyStorePassPhrase', type='Certificate', filepath='/tmp/cert.txt/') These commands download the certificate for the default demoidentity certificate at /tmp/cert.txt.\nb. Import the certificate to the Java trust store:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export JAVA_HOME=/u01/jdk [oracle@helper oracle]$ keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias soadomain -file /tmp/cert.txt -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -keypass changeit -storepass changeit c. Connect to WLST and set the required environment variable before connecting using t3s:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export WLST_PROPERTIES=\u0026quot;-Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true\u0026quot; [oracle@helper oracle]$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin [oracle@helper bin]$ ./wlst.sh d. Access t3s for the Administration Server.\nFor example, if the domainUID is soainfra, Administration Server name is AdminServer, and Administration Server SSL port is 7002, connect to the Administration Server as follows:\nwls:/offline\u0026gt; connect('weblogic','\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;','t3s://soainfra-adminserver:7002') e.

	"content": "As described in Prepare Your Environment you can create your own OUD container image. If you have access to the My Oracle Support (MOS), and there is a need to build a new image with an interim or one off patch, it is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build an Oracle Unified Directory image for production deployments.\nCreate or update an Oracle Unified Directory image using the WebLogic Image Tool Using the WebLogic Image Tool, you can create a new Oracle Unified Directory image with PSU\u0026rsquo;s and interim patches or update an existing image with one or more interim patches.\n Recommendations:\n Use create for creating a new Oracle Unified Directory image containing the Oracle Unified Directory binaries, bundle patch and interim patches. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the OUD patches because it optimizes the size of the image. Use update for patching an existing Oracle Unified Directory image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Create an image Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it:\n$ mdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle Unified Directory container image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle Unified Directory domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts.

In the OAM Server Protocol drop down list select https.\n  Click Apply.\n  Register a WebGate Agent In all the examples below, change the directory path as appropriate for your installation.\n  Run the following command on the server with Oracle HTTP Server and WebGate installed:\n$ cd \u0026lt;OHS_ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt;/webgate/ohs/tools/deployWebGate $ ./deployWebGateInstance.sh -w \u0026lt;OHS_DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs_k8s -oh \u0026lt;OHS_ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt; -ws ohs The output will look similar to the following:\nCopying files from WebGate Oracle Home to WebGate Instancedir   Run the following command to update the OHS configuration files appropriately:\n$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\u0026lt;OHS_ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt;/lib $ cd \u0026lt;OHS_ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt;/webgate/ohs/tools/setup/InstallTools/ $ ./EditHttpConf -w \u0026lt;OHS_DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs_k8s -oh \u0026lt;OHS_ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nThe web server configuration file was successfully updated \u0026lt;OHS_DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs_k8s/httpd.conf has been backed up as \u0026lt;OHS_DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs_k8s/httpd.conf.ORIG   Launch a browser, and access the OAM console. Navigate to Application Security → Quick Start Wizards → SSO Agent Registration. Register the agent in the usual way, download the configuration zip file and copy to the OHS WebGate server, for example: \u0026lt;OHS_DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs_k8/webgate/config. Extract the zip file.\n  Copy the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate (cacert.pem) for the load balancer/ingress certificate to the same directory e.g: \u0026lt;OHS_DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs_k8/webgate/config.\nIf you used a self signed certificate for the ingress, instead copy the self signed certificate (e.g: /scratch/ssl/tls.crt) to the above directory. Rename the certificate to cacert.pem.\n  Restart Oracle HTTP Server.\n  Access the configured OHS e.g http://ohs.example.com:7778, and check you are redirected to the SSO login page. Login and make sure you are redirected successfully to the home page.\n  Changing WebGate agent to use OAP Note: This section should only be followed if you need to change the OAM/WebGate Agent communication from HTTPS to OAP.\nTo change the WebGate agent to use OAP:\n  In the OAM Console click Application Security and then Agents.\n  Search for the agent you want modify and select it.\n  In the User Defined Parameters change:\na) OAMServerCommunicationMode from HTTPS to OAP. For example OAMServerCommunicationMode=OAP\nb) OAMRestEndPointHostName=\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt; to the {$MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}. For example OAMRestEndPointHostName=masternode.example.com\n  In the Server Lists section click Add to add a new server with the following values:\n Access Server: Other Host Name: \u0026lt;{$MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}\u0026gt; Host Port: \u0026lt;oamoap-service NodePort\u0026gt;  Note: To find the value for Host Port run the following:\n$ kubectl describe svc accessdomain-oamoap-service -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nName: accessdomain-oamoap-service Namespace: oamns Labels: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Annotations: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Selector: weblogic.clusterName=oam_cluster Type: NodePort IP Families: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; IP: 10.100.202.44 IPs: 10.100.202.44 Port: \u0026lt;unset\u0026gt; 5575/TCP TargetPort: 5575/TCP NodePort: \u0026lt;unset\u0026gt; 30540/TCP Endpoints: 10.244.5.21:5575,10.244.6.76:5575 Session Affinity: None External Traffic Policy: Cluster Events: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; In the example above the NodePort is 30540.\n  Delete all servers in Server Lists except for the one just created, and click Apply.\n  Click Download to download the webgate zip file.

Describe the operator pod using kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;operator-pod-name\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;operator-namespace\u0026gt; to identify any obvious errors.  RCU schema creation failure When creating the RCU schema using create-rcu-schema.sh, the possible causes for RCU schema creation failure are:\n Database is not up and running Incorrect database connection URL used Invalid database credentials used Schema prefix already exists  Make sure that all the above causes are reviewed and corrected as needed.\nAlso drop the existing schema with the same prefix before rerunning the create-rcu-schema.sh with correct values.\nDomain creation failure If the Oracle SOA Suite domain creation fails when running create-domain.sh, perform the following steps to diagnose the issue:\n  Run the following command to diagnose the create domain job:\n$ kubectl logs jobs/\u0026lt;domain_job\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl logs jobs/soainfra-create-soa-infra-domain-job -n soans Also run:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;domain_job\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl describe pod soainfra-create-soa-infra-domain-job-mcc6v -n soans Use the output to diagnose the problem and resolve the issue.\n  Clean up the failed domain creation:\n Delete the failed domain creation job in the domain namespace using the command kubectl delete job \u0026lt;domain-creation-job-name\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain-namespace\u0026gt;.

This error is reported when there is an issue with database schema access during domain creation. The possible causes are:\n Incorrect schema name specified in create-domain-inputs.yaml. RCU schema credentials specified in the secret soainfra-rcu-credentials are different from the credentials specified while creating the RCU schema using create-rcu-schema.sh.  To resolve these possible causes, check that the schema name and credentials used during the domain creation are the same as when the RCU schema was created.\nServer pods not started after applying domain configuration file When a domain configuration file (YAML) is deployed and no introspector or server pods are initiated, as well as there is no mention of the domain in the operator log, ensure that the domain\u0026rsquo;s namespace has been configured to be managed by WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nThe domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy configuration in the operator installation Helm chart determines the namespaces managed by operators. The default value of the domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy Helm chart value was altered between versions 3.4 and 4.0. In version 3.4, the default value was List and in version 4.0, the default value is LabelSelector. Therefore, instead of managing the set of namespaces listed in the domainNamespaces Helm chart value, the operator now searches for namespaces with the label specified in the domainNamespaceLabelSelector Helm chart value, which defaults to weblogic-operator=enabled.\nFor operator versions 3.4 and lower, you can verify the configuration by running the command helm get values \u0026lt;operator-release\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;operator-namespace\u0026gt; and checking the values under the domainNamespaces section.\nFor example:\n$ helm get values weblogic-kubernetes-operator -n opns USER-SUPPLIED VALUES: domainNamespaces: - soans image: ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.4.4 javaLoggingLevel: FINE serviceAccount: op-sa $ If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the domain namespace value under the domainNamespaces section, run the helm upgrade command in the operator namespace with appropriate values to configure the operator to manage the domain namespace.\n$ helm upgrade --reuse-values --namespace opns --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={soans}\u0026quot; --wait weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator For operator versions 4.0 and higher, verify if the label weblogic-operator=enabled is specified for domain namespace that is to be managed by the operator, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl get ns --selector=\u0026quot;weblogic-operator=enabled\u0026quot; For example, if your domain namespace is soans and the preceding command did not list the soans namespace, then execute the following command for operator to manage the domain namespace:\n$ kubectl label namespace soans weblogic-operator=enabled Ingress controller not serving the domain URLs To diagnose this issue:\n Verify that the Ingress controller is installed successfully.\nFor example, to verify the Traefik Ingress controller status, run the following command: $ helm list -n traefik NAME NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED STATUS CHART APP VERSION traefik traefik 2 2022-11-30 11:31:18.599876918 +0000 UTC deployed traefik-20.5.3 v2.9.5 $  Verify that the Ingress controller is setup to monitor the domain namespace.\nFor example, to verify the Traefik Ingress controller manages the soans domain namespace, run the following command and check the values under namespaces section. $ helm get values traefik-operator -n traefik USER-SUPPLIED VALUES: kubernetes: namespaces: - traefik - soans $  Verify that the Ingress chart is installed correctly in domain namespace. For example, run the following command: $ helm list -n soans NAME NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED STATUS CHART APP VERSION soainfra-traefik soans 1 2021-10-27 11:24:31.7572791 +0000 UTC deployed ingress-per-domain-0.1.0 1.0 $  Verify that the Ingress URL paths and hostnames are configured correctly by running the following commands:   Click here to see the sample commands and output   $ kubectl get ingress soainfra-traefik -n soans NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE soainfra-traefik \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Hostname\u0026gt; 80 20h $ $ kubectl describe ingress soainfra-traefik -n soans Name: soainfra-traefik Namespace: soans Address: Default backend: default-http-backend:80 (\u0026lt;error: endpoints \u0026quot;default-http-backend\u0026quot; not found\u0026gt;) Rules: Host Path Backends ---- ---- -------- \u0026lt;Hostname\u0026gt; /console soainfra-adminserver:7001 (10.244.0.123:7001) /em soainfra-adminserver:7001 (10.244.0.123:7001) /weblogic/ready soainfra-adminserver:7001 (10.244.0.123:7001) /soa-infra soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster:8001 (10.244.0.126:8001,10.244.0.127:8001) /soa/composer soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster:8001 (10.244.0.126:8001,10.244.0.127:8001) /integration/worklistapp soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster:8001 (10.244.0.126:8001,10.244.0.127:8001) /EssHealthCheck soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster:8001 (10.244.0.126:8001,10.244.0.127:8001) Annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik meta.helm.sh/release-name: soainfra-traefik meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: soans Events: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; $     Security warnings reported in WebLogic Administration console With the July 2021 PSU applied, WebLogic Server regularly validates your domain configuration settings against a set of security configuration guidelines to determine whether the domain meets key security guidelines recommended by Oracle.

	"content": "As described in Prepare Your Environment you can create your own OAM container image. If you have access to the My Oracle Support (MOS), and there is a need to build a new image with an interim or one off patch, it is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build an Oracle Access Management image for production deployments.\nCreate or update an Oracle Access Management image using the WebLogic Image Tool Using the WebLogic Image Tool, you can create a new Oracle Access Management image with PSU\u0026rsquo;s and interim patches or update an existing image with one or more interim patches.\n Recommendations:\n Use create for creating a new Oracle Access Management image containing the Oracle Access Management binaries, bundle patch and interim patches. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the OAM patches because it optimizes the size of the image. Use update for patching an existing Oracle Access Management image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Create an image Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it:\n$ mdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle Access Management container image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle Access Management domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git    Note: If you want to create the image continue with the following steps, otherwise to update the image see update an image.\n Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle Access Management image.\nDownload the Oracle Access Management installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle Access Management installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice.\nThe installation binaries and patches required are:\n  Oracle Identity and Access Management 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_idm.jar    Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c Infrastructure 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_infrastructure.jar    OAM and FMW Infrastructure Patches:\n View document ID 2723908.1 on My Oracle Support.

	"content": "As described in Prepare Your Environment you can create your own OIG container image. If you have access to the My Oracle Support (MOS), and there is a need to build a new image with an interim or one off patch, it is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build an Oracle Identity Governance image for production deployments.\nCreate or update an Oracle Identity Governance image using the WebLogic Image Tool Using the WebLogic Image Tool, you can create a new Oracle Identity Governance image with PSU\u0026rsquo;s and interim patches or update an existing image with one or more interim patches.\n Recommendations:\n Use create for creating a new Oracle Identity Governance image containing the Oracle Identity Governance binaries, bundle patch and interim patches. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the OIG patches because it optimizes the size of the image. Use update for patching an existing Oracle Identity Governance image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Create an image Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle Identity Governance container image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle Identity Governance domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git    Note: If you want to create the image continue with the following steps, otherwise to update the image see update an image.\n Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle Identity Governance image.\nDownload the Oracle Identity Governance installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle Identity Governance installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice.\nThe installation binaries and patches required are:\n  Oracle Identity and Access Management 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_idm.jar    Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c Infrastructure 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_infrastructure.jar    Oracle SOA Suite for Oracle Middleware 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_soa.jar    Oracle Service Bus 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_osb.jar    OIG and FMW Infrastructure Patches:\n View document ID 2723908.1 on My Oracle Support.

	"content": "Introduction This section describes how to increase or decrease the number of OUD pods in the Kubernetes deployment.\nNote: The instructions below are for scaling servers up or down manually. If you wish to use autoscaling, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Please note, if you have enabled autoscaling, it is recommended to delete the autoscaler before running the commands below.\nView existing OUD pods By default the oud-ds-rs helm chart deployment starts three pods: oud-ds-rs-0 and two replica pods oud-ds-rs-1 and oud-ds-rs-2.\nThe number of pods started is determined by the replicaCount, which is set to 3 by default. A value of 3 starts the three pods above.\nTo scale up or down the number of OUD pods, set replicaCount accordingly.\nRun the following command to view the number of pods in the OUD deployment:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; get pods -o wide For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get pods -o wide The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES pod/oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 22h 10.244.0.195 \u0026lt;Worker Node\u0026gt;

AdminServer   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is oam_cluster for the OAM domain. oam_cluster   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path wdt, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the OAM domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. accessdomain   domainType Type of the domain. Mandatory input for OAM domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type value: oam (deploys an OAM domain) oam   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. true   image OAM container image. The operator requires OAM 12.2.1.4. Refer to Obtain the OAM container image for details on how to obtain or create the image. oracle/oam:12.2.1.4.0   imagePullPolicy WebLogic container image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the container registry to pull the OAM container image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/accessdomain   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. oam_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. accessns   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. accessdomain-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are Never, IfNeeded, AdminOnly. IfNeeded   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. accessdomain-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the container registry, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example OAM1. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. OAM1   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. accessdomain-rcu-credentials   datasourceType Type of JDBC datasource applicable for the OAM domain. Legal values are agl and generic. Choose agl for Active GridLink datasource and generic for Generic datasource. For enterprise deployments, Oracle recommends that you use GridLink data sources to connect to Oracle RAC databases. See the Enterprise Deployment Guide for further details. generic    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an OAM domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script   Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o /\u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output The output will look similar to the following:\nInput parameters being used export version=\u0026quot;create-weblogic-sample-domain-inputs-v1\u0026quot; export adminPort=\u0026quot;7001\u0026quot; export adminServerName=\u0026quot;AdminServer\u0026quot; export domainUID=\u0026quot;accessdomain\u0026quot; export domainType=\u0026quot;oam\u0026quot; export domainHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain\u0026quot; export serverStartPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNeeded\u0026quot; export clusterName=\u0026quot;oam_cluster\u0026quot; export configuredManagedServerCount=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; export initialManagedServerReplicas=\u0026quot;2\u0026quot; export managedServerNameBase=\u0026quot;oam_server\u0026quot; export managedServerPort=\u0026quot;14100\u0026quot; export image=\u0026quot;container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oam_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October`23\u0026gt;\u0026quot; export imagePullPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; export imagePullSecretName=\u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot; export productionModeEnabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export weblogicCredentialsSecretName=\u0026quot;accessdomain-credentials\u0026quot; export includeServerOutInPodLog=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export logHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/accessdomain\u0026quot; export httpAccessLogInLogHome=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export t3ChannelPort=\u0026quot;30012\u0026quot; export exposeAdminT3Channel=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export adminNodePort=\u0026quot;30701\u0026quot; export exposeAdminNodePort=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export namespace=\u0026quot;oamns\u0026quot; javaOptions=-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false export persistentVolumeClaimName=\u0026quot;accessdomain-domain-pvc\u0026quot; export domainPVMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptsMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/weblogic\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptName=\u0026quot;create-domain-job.sh\u0026quot; export createDomainFilesDir=\u0026quot;wlst\u0026quot; export rcuSchemaPrefix=\u0026quot;OAMK8S\u0026quot; export rcuDatabaseURL=\u0026quot;mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com\u0026quot; export rcuCredentialsSecret=\u0026quot;accessdomain-rcu-credentials\u0026quot; export datasourceType=\u0026quot;generic\u0026quot; validateWlsDomainName called with accessdomain createFiles - valuesInputFile is create-domain-inputs.yaml createDomainScriptName is create-domain-job.sh Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/create-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/delete-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/domain.yaml Checking to see if the secret accessdomain-credentials exists in namespace oamns configmap/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm created Checking the configmap accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm was created configmap/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm labeled Checking if object type job with name accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job exists No resources found in oamns namespace.

The minimum recommended values are -Xms4096m -Xmx8192m. However, Oracle recommends you to set these to -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m in a production environment.\n  Navigate to the /output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain   Edit the domain.yaml file and inside name: accessdomain-oam-cluster, add the memory setting as below:\n serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; For example:\napiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: accessdomain-oam-cluster namespace: oamns spec: clusterName: oam_cluster serverService: precreateService: true serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; replicas: 1 Note: The above CPU and memory values are for development environments only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\nNote: If required you can also set the same resources and limits for the accessdomain-policy-cluster.\n  In the domain.yaml locate the section of the file starting with adminServer:. Under the env: tag add the following CLASSPATH entries. This is required for running the idmconfigtool from the Administration Server.\n- name: CLASSPATH value: \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/wlserver/server/lib/weblogic.jar\u0026quot; For example:\n# adminServer is used to configure the desired behavior for starting the administration server. adminServer: # adminService: # channels: # The Admin Server's NodePort # - channelName: default # nodePort: 30701 # Uncomment to export the T3Channel as a service # - channelName: T3Channel serverPod: # an (optional) list of environment variable to be set on the admin servers env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms512m -Xmx1024m \u0026quot; - name: CLASSPATH value: \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/wlserver/server/lib/weblogic.jar\u0026quot;   If required, you can add the optional parameter maxClusterConcurrentStartup to the spec section of the domain.yaml. This parameter specifies the number of managed servers to be started in sequence per cluster. For example if you updated the initialManagedServerReplicas to 4 in create-domain-inputs.yaml and only had 2 nodes, then setting maxClusterConcurrentStartup: 1 will start one managed server at a time on each node, rather than starting them all at once. This can be useful to take the strain off individual nodes at startup. Below is an example with the parameter added:\napiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v9\u0026quot; kind: Domain metadata: name: accessdomain namespace: oamns labels: weblogic.domainUID: accessdomain spec: # The WebLogic Domain Home domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain maxClusterConcurrentStartup: 1 # The domain home source type # Set to PersistentVolume for domain-in-pv, Image for domain-in-image, or FromModel for model-in-image domainHomeSourceType: PersistentVolume ....   Save the changes to domain.yaml\n  Initializing the domain   Create the Kubernetes resource using the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;/domain.yaml For example:\n$ kubectl apply -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/domain.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain created cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster created cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-policy-cluster created   Verify the results Verify the domain, pods and services   Verify the domain, servers pods and services are created and in the READY state with a status of 1/1, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 11m pod/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 18m pod/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3m31s pod/accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3m31s pod/helper 1/1 Running 0 33m NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/accessdomain-adminserver ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 7001/TCP 11m service/accessdomain-cluster-oam-cluster ClusterIP 10.101.59.154 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-cluster-policy-cluster ClusterIP 10.98.236.51 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 ClusterIP 10.104.92.12 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 ClusterIP 10.96.244.37 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 ClusterIP 10.105.201.23 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr5 ClusterIP 10.110.12.227 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server2 ClusterIP 10.96.137.33 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server3 ClusterIP 10.103.178.35 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server4 ClusterIP 10.97.254.78 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server5 ClusterIP 10.105.65.104 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job 1/1 2m6s 18m NAME AGE domain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain 12m NAME AGE cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster 11m cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-policy-cluster 11m Note: It will take several minutes before all the services listed above show. When a pod has a STATUS of 0/1 the pod is started but the OAM server associated with it is currently starting. While the pods are starting you can check the startup status in the pod logs, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl logs accessdomain-adminserver -n oamns $ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 -n oamns $ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-server1 -n oamns etc.. The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001. A configured OAM cluster named oam_cluster of size 5. A configured Policy Manager cluster named policy_cluster of size 5. One started OAM Managed Server, named oam_server1, listening on port 14100. One started Policy Manager Managed Servers named oam-policy-mgr1, listening on port 15100. Log files that are located in \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;.    Verify the domain   Run the following command to describe the domain:\n$ kubectl describe domain \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl describe domain accessdomain -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nName: accessdomain Namespace: oamns Labels: weblogic.domainUID=accessdomain Annotations: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt;

The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain.\nNote: If you want to create the OIG domain using WDT models, skip the steps below and go to Create OIG Domains Using WDT Models.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n Review the Domain resource documentation. Ensure that you have executed all the preliminary steps documented in Prepare your environment. Ensure that the database is up and running.

These values will be changed to the correct values in post installation tasks in Set OIMFrontendURL using MBeans.\n  A full list of parameters in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file are shown below:\n   Parameter Definition Default     adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is oimcluster for the OIG domain. oimcluster   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path wdt, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the OIG domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/oimcluster   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. oimcluster   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. true   image OIG container image. The operator requires OIG 12.2.1.4. Refer to OIG domains for details on how to obtain or create the image. oracle/oig:12.2.1.4.0   imagePullPolicy WebLogic container image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the container registry to pull the OIG container image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/oimcluster   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. oim_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. oimcluster   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. oimcluster-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are Never, IfNeeded, AdminOnly. IfNeeded   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. oimcluster-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the container registry, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example OIGK8S. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. OIGK8S   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. oimcluster-rcu-credentials   frontEndHost The entry point URL for the OIM. Not set   frontEndPort The entry point port for the OIM. Not set   datasourceType Type of JDBC datasource applicable for the OIG domain. Legal values are agl and generic. Choose agl for Active GridLink datasource and generic for Generic datasource. For enterprise deployments, Oracle recommends that you use GridLink data sources to connect to Oracle RAC databases. See the Enterprise Deployment Guide for further details. generic    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an OIG domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script Generate the create domain script   Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ mkdir output $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o /\u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ mkdir output $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output The output will look similar to the following:\nInput parameters being used export version=\u0026quot;create-weblogic-sample-domain-inputs-v1\u0026quot; export adminPort=\u0026quot;7001\u0026quot; export adminServerName=\u0026quot;AdminServer\u0026quot; export domainUID=\u0026quot;governancedomain\u0026quot; export domainHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/governancedomain\u0026quot; export serverStartPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNeeded\u0026quot; export clusterName=\u0026quot;oim_cluster\u0026quot; export configuredManagedServerCount=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; export initialManagedServerReplicas=\u0026quot;1\u0026quot; export managedServerNameBase=\u0026quot;oim_server\u0026quot; export managedServerPort=\u0026quot;14000\u0026quot; export image=\u0026quot;container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol7-\u0026lt;October'23\u0026gt;\u0026quot; export imagePullPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; export imagePullSecretName=\u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot; export productionModeEnabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export weblogicCredentialsSecretName=\u0026quot;oig-domain-credentials\u0026quot; export includeServerOutInPodLog=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export logHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/governancedomain\u0026quot; export t3ChannelPort=\u0026quot;30012\u0026quot; export exposeAdminT3Channel=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export adminNodePort=\u0026quot;30701\u0026quot; export exposeAdminNodePort=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export namespace=\u0026quot;oigns\u0026quot; javaOptions=-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false export persistentVolumeClaimName=\u0026quot;governancedomain-domain-pvc\u0026quot; export domainPVMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptsMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/weblogic\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptName=\u0026quot;create-domain-job.sh\u0026quot; export createDomainFilesDir=\u0026quot;wlst\u0026quot; export rcuSchemaPrefix=\u0026quot;OIGK8S\u0026quot; export rcuDatabaseURL=\u0026quot;mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com\u0026quot; export rcuCredentialsSecret=\u0026quot;oig-rcu-credentials\u0026quot; export frontEndHost=\u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot; export frontEndPort=\u0026quot;14100\u0026quot; export datasourceType=\u0026quot;generic\u0026quot; validateWlsDomainName called with governancedomain createFiles - valuesInputFile is create-domain-inputs.yaml createDomainScriptName is create-domain-job.sh Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/create-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/delete-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/domain.yaml Checking to see if the secret governancedomain-domain-credentials exists in namespace oigns configmap/governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm created Checking the configmap governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm was created configmap/governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm labeled Checking if object type job with name governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job exists No resources found in oigns namespace.

Note: The above CPU and memory values are for development environments only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\nNote: If required you can also set the same resources and limits for the governancedomain-soa-cluster.\n  Run the create domain scripts   Create the Kubernetes resource using the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; $ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain $ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain unchanged cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster created cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-soa-cluster created   Run the following command to view the status of the OIG pods:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will initially look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8cww8 0/1 Completed 0 27m governancedomain-introspect-domain-job-p4brt 1/1 Running 0 6s helper 1/1 Running 0 3h30m The introspect-domain-job pod will be displayed first.

Please note, if you have enabled autoscaling, it is recommended to delete the autoscaler before running the commands below.\nView existing OIG Servers The default OIG deployment starts the Administration Server (AdminServer), one OIG Managed Server (oim_server1) and one SOA Managed Server (soa_server1).\nThe deployment also creates, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t start, four extra OIG Managed Servers (oim-server2 to oim-server5) and four more SOA Managed Servers (soa_server2 to soa_server5).\nAll these servers are visible in the WebLogic Server Administration Console https://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:${MASTERNODE-PORT}/console by navigating to Domain Structure \u0026gt; governancedomain \u0026gt; Environment \u0026gt; Servers.\nTo view the running servers using kubectl, run the following command:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output should look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 23h governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8cww8 0/1 Completed 0 24h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 23h governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 23h Starting/Scaling up OIG Managed Servers The number of OIG Managed Servers running is dependent on the replicas parameter configured for the cluster. To start more OIG Managed Servers perform the following steps:\n  Run the following kubectl command to edit the oim_cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster \u0026lt;cluster_name\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl edit cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster -n oigns Note: This opens an edit session for the domain where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oim_cluster. By default the replicas parameter is set to \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; hence a single OIG Managed Server is started (oim_server1):\nspec: clusterName: oim_cluster replicas: 1 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m ...   To start more OIG Managed Servers, increase the replicas value as desired. In the example below, one more Managed Server will be started by setting replicas to \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo;:\nspec: clusterName: oim_cluster replicas: 2 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m ...

This means oim_server2 is not currently running but is in the process of starting. The server will take several minutes to start so keep executing the command until READY shows 1/1:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 23h governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8cww8 0/1 Completed 0 24h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 23h governancedomain-oim-server2 1/1 Running 0 5m27s governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 23h Note: To check what is happening during server startup when READY is 0/1, run the following command to view the log of the pod that is starting:\n$ kubectl logs \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl logs governancedomain-oim-server2 -n oigns   Stopping/Scaling down OIG Managed Servers As mentioned in the previous section, the number of OIG Managed Servers running is dependent on the replicas parameter configured for the cluster. To stop one or more OIG Managed Servers, perform the following:\n  Run the following kubectl command to edit the oim_cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster \u0026lt;cluster_name\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl edit cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster -n oigns   In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oim_cluster.

Verify the pods   After updating with the new image the pod will restart. Verify the pod is running:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; get pods For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudsmns get pods The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES pod/oudsm-1 1/1 Running 0 73m 10.244.0.19 \u0026lt;worker-node\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Note: It will take several minutes before the pod starts. While the oudsm pods have a STATUS of 0/1 the pod is started but the OUDSM server associated with it is currently starting. While the pod is starting you can check the startup status in the pod logs, by running the following command:\n  Verify the pod is using the new image by running the following command:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl describe pod oudsm-1 -n oudsmns The output will look similar to the following:\nName: oudsm-1 Namespace: oudsmns Priority: 0 Node: \u0026lt;worker-node\u0026gt;/100.102.48.28 Start Time: \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; Labels: app.kubernetes.io/instance=oudsm app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm app.kubernetes.io/name=oudsm app.kubernetes.io/version=12.2.1.4.0 helm.sh/chart=oudsm-0.1 oudsm/instance=oudsm-1 Annotations: meta.helm.sh/release-name: oudsm meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: oudsmns Status: Running IP: 10.244.1.90 etc...

	"content": " Introduction Install Elasticsearch and Kibana Create a Kubernetes secret Enable Logstash  Upgrade OUD deployment with ELK configuration Verify the pods   Verify and access the Kibana console  Introduction This section describes how to install and configure logging and visualization for the oud-ds-rs Helm chart deployment.\nThe ELK stack consists of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Using ELK you can gain insights in real-time from the log data from your applications.\n Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected. Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. It gives you the freedom to select the way you give shape to your data. And you don’t always have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.  Install Elasticsearch and Kibana If you do not already have a centralized Elasticsearch (ELK) stack then you must configure this first. For details on how to configure the ELK stack, follow Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana\nCreate the logstash pod Variables used in this chapter In order to create the logstash pod, you must create a yaml file. This file contains variables which you must substitute with variables applicable to your ELK environment.\nMost of the values for the variables will be based on your ELK deployment as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nThe table below outlines the variables and values you must set:\n   Variable Sample Value Description     \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; 8.3.1 The version of logstash you want to install.   \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; true If SSL is enabled for ELK set the value to true, or if NON-SSL set to false. This value must be lowercase.   \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200 The URL for sending logs to Elasticsearch. HTTP if NON-SSL is used.   \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; logstash_internal The name of the user for logstash to access Elasticsearch.   \u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; password The password for ELK_USER.   \u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; apikey The API key details.    You will also need the BASE64 version of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) that signed the certificate of the Elasticsearch server. If using a self-signed certificate, this is the self signed certificate of the Elasticsearch server. See Copying the Elasticsearch Certificate for details on how to get the correct certificate. In the example below the certificate is called elk.crt.\nCreate a kubernetes secret   Create a Kubernetes secret for Elasticsearch using the API Key or Password.\na) If ELK uses an API Key for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created b) If ELK uses a password for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created Note: It is recommended that the ELK Stack is created with authentication enabled. If no authentication is enabled you may create a secret using the values above.\n  Check that the dockercred secret that was created previously in Create a Kubernetes secret for cronjob images exists:\n$ kubectl get secret -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; | grep dockercred For example,\n$ kubectl get secret -n oudns | grep dockercred The output will look similar to the following:\ndockercred kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson 1 149m If the secret does not exist, create it as per Create a Kubernetes secret for cronjob images.\n  Enable logstash   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory and create a logging-override-values.yaml file as follows:\nelk: imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred IntegrationEnabled: true logStashImage: logstash:\u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; logstashConfigMap: false esindex: oudlogs-00001 sslenabled: \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; eshosts: \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; # Note: We need to provide either esuser,espassword or esapikey esuser: \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; espassword: elasticsearch-pw-elastic esapikey: elasticsearch-pw-elastic  Change the \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; to match the values for your environment. If using SSL, replace the elk.crt in $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm/oud-ds-rs/certs/ with the elk.crt for your ElasticSearch server.

	"description": "Describes the steps for logging and visualization with Elasticsearch and Kibana.",
	"content": "Introduction This section describes how to install and configure logging and visualization for the oudsm Helm chart deployment.\nThe ELK stack consists of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Using ELK you can gain insights in real-time from the log data from your applications.\n Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected. Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. It gives you the freedom to select the way you give shape to your data. And you don’t always have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.  Install Elasticsearch and Kibana If you do not already have a centralized Elasticsearch (ELK) stack then you must configure this first. For details on how to configure the ELK stack, follow Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana\nCreate the logstash pod Variables used in this chapter In order to create the logstash pod, you must create a yaml file. This file contains variables which you must substitute with variables applicable to your ELK environment.\nMost of the values for the variables will be based on your ELK deployment as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nThe table below outlines the variables and values you must set:\n   Variable Sample Value Description     \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; 8.3.1 The version of logstash you want to install.   \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; true If SSL is enabled for ELK set the value to true, or if NON-SSL set to false. This value must be lowercase.   \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200 The URL for sending logs to Elasticsearch. HTTP if NON-SSL is used.   \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; logstash_internal The name of the user for logstash to access Elasticsearch.   \u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; password The password for ELK_USER.   \u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; apikey The API key details.    You will also need the BASE64 version of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) that signed the certificate of the Elasticsearch server. If using a self-signed certificate, this is the self signed certificate of the Elasticsearch server. See Copying the Elasticsearch Certificate for details on how to get the correct certificate. In the example below the certificate is called elk.crt.\nCreate Kubernetes secrets   Create a Kubernetes secret for Elasticsearch using the API Key or Password.\na) If ELK uses an API Key for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudsmns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created b) If ELK uses a password for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudsmns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created Note: It is recommended that the ELK Stack is created with authentication enabled. If no authentication is enabled you may create a secret using the values above.\n  Create a Kubernetes secret to access the required images on hub.docker.com:\nNote: You must first have a user account on hub.docker.com:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;dockercred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026#34;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026#34; --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;docker_username\u0026gt;\u0026#34; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;docker_email_credentials\u0026gt; --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026quot;dockercred\u0026quot; --docker-server=\u0026quot;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026quot; --docker-username=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=user@example.com --namespace=oudsmns The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/dockercred created   Enable logstash   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory and create a logging-override-values.yaml file as follows:\nelk: imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred IntegrationEnabled: true logStashImage: logstash:\u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; logstashConfigMap: false esindex: oudsmlogs-00001 sslenabled: \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; eshosts: \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; # Note: We need to provide either esuser,espassword or esapikey esuser: \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; espassword: elasticsearch-pw-elastic esapikey: elasticsearch-pw-elastic  Change the \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt;, to match the values for your environment.

Verify the domain, pods and services\nb. Verify the domain\nc. Verify the pods\n  Introduction This section demonstrates the creation of an OAM domain home using sample Weblogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model files.\nBeginning with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.1.2, you can provide a section, domain.spec.configuration.initializeDomainOnPV, to initialize an OAM domain on a persistent volume when it is first deployed. This eliminates the need to pre-create your OAM domain using sample Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST) offline scripts.\nNote: This is a one time only initialization. After the domain is created, subsequent updates to this section in the domain resource YAML file will not recreate or update the WebLogic domain. Subsequent domain lifecycle updates must be controlled by the WebLogic Server Administration Console, Enterprise Manager Console, WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST), or other mechanisms.\nWeblogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) models are a convenient and simple alternative to WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) configuration scripts. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using model files, variable properties files, and application archive files. For more information about the model format and its integration, see Usage and Working with WDT Model files. The WDT model format is fully described in the open source, WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub project.\nThe main benefits of WDT are:\n A set of single-purpose tools supporting Weblogic domain configuration lifecycle operations. All tools work off of a shared, declarative model, eliminating the need to maintain specialized WLST scripts. WDT knowledge base understands the MBeans, attributes, and WLST capabilities/bugs across WLS versions.  The initializeDomainOnPv section:\n Creates the PersistentVolume (PV) and/or PersistenVolumeClaim (PVC). Creates the OAM domain home on the persistent volume based on the provided WDT models  Prerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n Review the Domain On PV documentation. Ensure that the database is up and running.  Working with WDT Model Files The code repository ($WORKDIR) contains different WDT model files to create an OAM domain. The following table defines these files:\nMore information on the WDT Metadata model see, Metadata model.\n   Model File Definition Required for base domain creation image     domainInfo.yaml The location where special information not represented in WLST is specified (for example, OPSS Initialization parameters). In most of the cases, you do not need to customize this. Y   topology.yaml The location where servers, clusters and other domain-level configuration is specified. You can customize this based on the topology that you need. Y   resources.yaml The location where resources and services are specified (for example, data sources, JMS, WLDF). You can customize this based on your environment specific requirement. For example, if you want to use different datasource connection pool parameters from the ones coming via template, you can add details here. Y   oam.properties The location where you can customize the default values for different parameters such as Listen Port, T3 Channel port etc. Y   agl_jdbc.yaml This is an optional model file specifying parameters needed to use Active Gridlink type of datasources for your domain N (Optional)    Preparing the environment for domain creation In this section you prepare the environment for the OAM domain creation using WDT models. This involves the following steps:\n Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU. Creating a persistent volume.  Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU   Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain using the create-weblogic-credentials script in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;username=weblogic\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; where:\n-n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; is the domain namespace.\n-d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; is the domain UID to be created.

The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\nTo create the persistent volume run the following commands:\n  Create the required directories:\n$ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv For example:\n$ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv touch file.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt   On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt   Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it’s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Create Domain Creation Image Domain creation images are used for supplying WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model files, WDT variables files, WDT application archive files (collectively known as WDT model files), and the directory where the WebLogic Deploy Tooling software is installed (known as the WDT Home) when deploying a domain using a Domain on PV model. You distribute WDT model files and the WDT executable using these images, then the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator uses them to manage the domain.\nNote: These images are only used for creating the domain and will not be used to update the domain.\nNote: The domain creation image is used for domain creation only, it is not the product container image used for OAM.\nFor more details on creating the domain image, see Domain creation images.\nThe steps to create the domain creation image are shown in the sections below.\nSet up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Prepare the WebLogic Image Tool Validate Setup WebLogic Image Tool Build Directory WebLogic Image Tool Cache  Image tool prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n A container image client on the build machine, such as Docker or Podman.  For Docker, a minimum version of 18.03.1.ce is required. For Podman, a minimum version of 3.0.1 is required.   Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. An installed version of Java to run Image Tool, version 8+. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Prepare the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and navigate to it:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ export JAVA_HOME=\u0026lt;JAVA_HOME\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ export JAVA_HOME=/scratch/imagetool-setup/jdk1.8.0_341 $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate Setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create createAuxImage inspect rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool Build Directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user’s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool Cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user’s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Download WDT Installer WDT models are a convenient and simple alternative to WLST configuration scripts. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using model files, variable properties files, and application archive files. For more information about the model format and its integration, see Usage and Working with WDT Model files. The WDT model format is fully described in the open source, WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub project.\nCreation of OAM domain using sample WDT files is supported from WDT version 3.2.4 onwards.\nRun the following steps to download and configure WDT for OAM deployment:\n  Create a working directory:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/wdt-setup $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/wdt-setup   For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/wdt-setup $ cd /scratch/wdt-setup   Download the WDT tool from releases page:\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/download/release-3.2.4/weblogic-deploy.zip   Unzip and add the OAM domain type definition in WDT:\n$ unzip weblogic-deploy.zip $ cp $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/OAM.json weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/ $ zip -r weblogic-deploy.zip weblogic-deploy   Create OAM domain creation image   Add the WDT installer in imagetool:\n$ imagetool cache addInstaller --type wdt --version latest --path /scratch/wdt-setup/weblogic-deploy.zip The output should look similar to the following:\n[INFO ] Successfully added to cache. wdt_latest=/scratch/wdt-setup/weblogic-deploy.zip   Create the image:\n$ imagetool createAuxImage --tag oam-aux:v1 \\ --wdtModel $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/domainInfo.yaml,\\ $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/resource.yaml,\\ $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/topology.yaml \\ --wdtVariables $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/oam.properties \\ --fromImage ghcr.io/oracle/oraclelinux:7-slim Note: If using podman add --builder podman to the command.

Verify the domain, pods and services\nb. Verify the domain\nc. Verify the pods\n  Introduction This section demonstrates the creation of an OIG domain home using sample WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model files.\nBeginning with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.1.2, you can provide a section, domain.spec.configuration.initializeDomainOnPV, to initialize an OIG domain on a persistent volume when it is first deployed. This eliminates the need to pre-create your OIG domain using sample Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST) offline scripts.\nNote This is a one time only initialization. After the domain is created, subsequent updates to this section in the domain resource YAML file will not recreate or update the WebLogic domain. Subsequent domain lifecycle updates must be controlled by the WebLogic Server Administration Console, Enterprise Manager Console, WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST), or other mechanisms.\nWebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) models are a convenient and simple alternative to WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) configuration scripts. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using model files, variable properties files, and application archive files. For more information about the model format and its integration, see Usage and Working with WDT Model files. The WDT model format is fully described in the open source, WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub project.\nThe main benefits of WDT are:\n A set of single-purpose tools supporting WebLogic domain configuration lifecycle operations. All tools work off of a shared, declarative model, eliminating the need to maintain specialized WLST scripts. WDT knowledge base understands the MBeans, attributes, and WLST capabilities/bugs across WLS versions.  The initializeDomainOnPv section:\n Creates the PersistentVolume (PV) and/or PersistenVolumeClaim (PVC). Creates the OIG domain home on the persistent volume based on the provided WDT models.  Prerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n Review the domain-on-pv documentation. Ensure that the database is up and running. RCU Schemas are created and patched.  Working with WDT Model Files The code repository ($WORKDIR) contains different WDT model files to create an OIG domain. The following table defines these files:\nMore information on the WDT Metadata model see, Metadata model.\n   Model File Definition Required for base domain creation image     domainInfo.yaml The location where special information not represented in WLST is specified (for example, OPSS Initialization parameters). In most of the cases, you do not need to customize this file Y   topology.yaml The location where servers, clusters and other domain-level configuration is specified. You can customize this based on the topology that you need. Y   resources.yaml The location where resources and services are specified (for example, data sources, JMS, WLDF). You can customize this based on your environment specific requirement. For example, if you want to use different datasource connection pool parameters from the ones coming via template, you can add details here. Y   oig.properties The location where you can customize the default values for different parameters such as Listen Port, T3 Channel port etc. Y   agl_jdbc.yaml This is an optional model file specifying parameters needed to use Active Gridlink type of datasources for your domain N (Optional)    Preparing the environment for domain creation In this section you prepare the environment for the OIG domain creation using WDT models. This involves the following steps:\n  Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU\n  Creating a persistent volume\n  Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU   Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain using the create-secret.sh script in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;username=weblogic\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;password=****\u0026#34; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; where:\n-n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; is the domain namespace.\n-d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; is the domain UID to be created.\n-s \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; is the name you want to create for the secret for this namespace.\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;username=weblogic\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -n oigns -d governancedomain -s governancedomain-weblogic-credentials The output will look similar to the following:\n@@ Info: Setting up secret \u0026#39;governancedomain-weblogic-credentials\u0026#39;. secret/governancedomain-weblogic-credentials created secret/governancedomain-weblogic-credentials labeled   Verify the secret is created using the following command:\n$ kubectl get secret \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; -o yaml -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get secret governancedomain-weblogic-credentials -o yaml -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\napiVersion: v1 data: password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;

uid: 71cfcc73-4c96-42bd-b9a5-988ea9ed27ff type: Opaque   Create Persistent Volume As referenced in Prerequisites the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must have access to a persistent volume such as a Network File System (NFS) mount or a shared file system.\nDomain on persistent volume (Domain on PV) is an operator domain home source type, which requires that the domain home exists on a persistent volume.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Oracle Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\nTo create the persistent volume run the following commands:\n  Create the required directories:\n$ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv For example,\n$ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv touch file.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt   On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt   Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it’s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Create Domain Creation Image Domain creation images are used for supplying WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model files, WDT variables files, WDT application archive files (collectively known as WDT model files), and the directory where the WebLogic Deploy Tooling software is installed (known as the WDT Home) when deploying a domain using a Domain on PV model. You distribute WDT model files and the WDT executable using these images, then the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator uses them to manage the domain.\nNote: These images are only used for creating the domain and will not be used to update the domain.\nNote: The domain creation image is used for domain creation only, it is not the product container image used for OIG.\nFor more details on creating the domain image, see Domain creation images.\nThe steps to create the domain creation image are shown in the sections below.\nSet up the WebLogic Image Tool  Image tool prerequisites Prepare the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache  Image tool prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n A container image client on the build machine, such as Docker or Podman.  For Docker, a minimum version of 18.03.1.ce is required. For Podman, a minimum version of 3.0.1 is required.   Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. An installed version of Java to run Image Tool, version 8+. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Prepare the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ export JAVA_HOME=\u0026lt;JAVA_HOME\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ export JAVA_HOME=/scratch/imagetool-setup/jdk1.8.0_341 $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create createAuxImage inspect rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool Build Directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user’s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool Cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user’s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Download WDT Installer WDT models are a convenient and simple alternative to WLST configuration scripts. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using model files, variable properties files, and application archive files. For more information about the model format and its integration, see Usage and Working with WDT Model files. The WDT model format is fully described in the open source, WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub project.\nCreation of an OIG domain using sample WDT model files is supported from WDT version 3.2.4 onwards.\nRun the following steps to download and configure WDT for OIG deployment:\n  Create a working directory:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;   For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/wdt-setup $ cd /scratch/wdt-setup   Download the WDT tool from releases page:\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/download/release-3.2.4/weblogic-deploy.zip   Unzip and add OIG domain type definition in WDT:\n$ unzip weblogic-deploy.zip $ cp $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/OIG.json weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/ $ zip -r weblogic-deploy.zip weblogic-deploy   Create OIG domain creation image   Add WDT installer in imagetool cache:\n$ imagetool cache addInstaller --type wdt --version latest --path /scratch/wdt-setup/weblogic-deploy.zip   Create the image:\n$ imagetool createAuxImage --tag oig-aux:v1 \\ --wdtModel $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/domainInfo.yaml,\\ $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/resource.yaml,\\ $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/topology.yaml \\ --wdtVariables $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-artifacts/oig.properties \\ --fromImage ghcr.io/oracle/oraclelinux:7-slim Note: If using podman add --builder podman to the command. Make sure podman is on the $PATH before executing.\nThe output will look similar to the following:\n [INFO ] WebLogic Image Tool version 1.12.1 [INFO ] Image Tool build ID: 7e0cc147-9b68-4350-bef4-c04eff5f5490 [INFO ] User specified fromImage ghcr.io/oracle/oraclelinux:7-slim [INFO ] Temporary directory used for image build context: /scratch/wlsimgbuilder_temp8804718050511845993 [INFO ] Inspecting ghcr.io/oracle/oraclelinux:7-slim, this may take a few minutes if the image is not available locally.

	"content": "Introduction The OIG domain patching script automatically performs the update of your OIG Kubernetes cluster with a new OIG container image.\nNote: Before following the steps below, you must have upgraded to WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.X.X.\nImportant: DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT IF YOU HAVE CREATED AN OIG DOMAIN USING WDT MODELS, which is released as part of Nov'23 content (23.4.2). If you need to patch an image you can use the manual way of patching an OIG domain as per 22.3.1. The patch automation script is being updated to support patching of domains created using WDT models, and will be available in a future release.\nThe script executes the following steps sequentially:\n Checks if the helper pod exists in the given namespace. If yes, then it deletes the helper pod. Brings up a new helper pod with the new image. Stops the Administration Server, SOA and OIM managed servers using serverStartPolicy set as Never in the domain definition yaml. Waits for all servers to be stopped (default timeout 2000s) Introspects database properties including credentials from the job configmap. Performs database schema changes from the helper pod Starts the Administration Server, SOA and OIM managed servers by setting serverStartPolicy to IfNeeded and image to new image tag. Waits for all the servers to be ready (default timeout 2000s)  The script exits with a failure if a configurable timeout is reached before the target pod count is reached, depending upon the domain configuration.

If the pod fails you can view the pod log using:\n$ kubectl logs -f oam-logstash-\u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oamns Most errors occur due to misconfiguration of the logstash_cm.yaml or logstash.yaml. This is usually because of an incorrect value set, or the certificate was not pasted with the correct indentation.\nIf the pod has errors, delete the pod and configmap as follows:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash.yaml $ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash_cm.yaml Once you have resolved the issue in the yaml files, run the commands outlined earlier to recreate the configmap and logstash pod.\n  Verify and access the Kibana console To access the Kibana console you will need the Kibana URL as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nFor Kibana 7.7.x and below:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Kibana \u0026gt; Index Patterns.\n  In the Create Index Pattern page enter oamlogs* for the Index pattern and click Next Step.\n  In the Configure settings page, from the Time Filter field name drop down menu select @timestamp and click Create index pattern.\n  Once the index pattern is created click on Discover in the navigation menu to view the OAM logs.\n  For Kibana version 7.8.X and above:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Stack Management.\n  Click Data Views in the Kibana section.\n  Click Create Data View and enter the following information:\n Name: oamlogs* Timestamp: @timestamp    Click Create Data View.\n  From the Navigation menu, click Discover to view the log file entries.\n  From the drop down menu, select oamlogs* to view the log file entries.\n  "

	"content": " Prerequisite configuration Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server  Troubleshooting   Deploy HPA Testing HPA Delete the HPA Other considerations  Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) allows automatic scaling (up and down) of the OUD servers. If load increases then extra OUD servers will be started as required. Similarly, if load decreases, OUD servers will be automatically shutdown.\nFor more information on HPA, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\nThe instructions below show you how to configure and run an HPA to scale OUD servers, based on CPU utilization or memory resource metrics.\nNote: If you enable HPA and then decide you want to start/stop/scale OUD servers manually as per Scaling Up/Down OUD Pods, it is recommended to delete HPA beforehand as per Delete the HPA.\nPrerequisite configuration In order to use HPA, OUD must have been created with the required resources parameter as per Create OUD instances. For example:\noudConfig: # memory, cpu parameters for both requests and limits for oud instances resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;500m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; If you created the OUD servers at any point since July 22 (22.3.1) then these values are the defaults. You can check using the following command:\n$ helm show values oud-ds-rs -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\n... # memory, cpu parameters for both requests and limits for oud instances resources: requests: memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; cpu: \u0026quot;500m\u0026quot; limits: memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; ... Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server Before deploying HPA you must deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n  Check to see if the Kubernetes Metrics Server is already deployed:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric If a row is returned as follows, then Kubernetes Metric Server is deployed and you can move to Deploy HPA.\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 5m13s   If no rows are returned by the previous command, then the Kubernetes Metric Server needs to be deployed. Run the following commands to get the components.yaml:\n$ mkdir $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml   Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/metrics-server created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created service/metrics-server created deployment.apps/metrics-server created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created   Run the following command to check Kubernetes Metric Server is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric Make sure the pod has a READY status of 1/1:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 39s   Troubleshooting If the Kubernetes Metric Server does not reach the READY 1/1 state, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system $ kubectl logs \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system If you see errors such as:\nReadiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500 and:\nE0907 13:07:50.937308 1 scraper.go:140] \u0026quot;Failed to scrape node\u0026quot; err=\u0026quot;Get \\\u0026quot;https://X.X.X.X:10250/metrics/resource\\\u0026quot;: x509: cannot validate certificate for 100.105.18.113 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs\u0026quot; node=\u0026quot;worker-node1\u0026quot; then you may need to install a valid cluster certificate for your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor testing purposes, you can resolve this issue by:\n  Delete the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml   Edit the $WORKDIR/hpa/components.yaml and locate the args: section. Add kubelet-insecure-tls to the arguments. For example:\nspec: containers: - args: - --cert-dir=/tmp - --secure-port=4443 - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname - --kubelet-use-node-status-port - --kubelet-insecure-tls - --metric-resolution=15s image: registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.6.4 ...   Deploy the Kubenetes Metrics Server using the command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml Run the following and make sure the READY status shows 1/1:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric The output should look similar to the following:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 40s   Deploy HPA The steps below show how to configure and run an HPA to scale OUD, based on the CPU or memory utilization resource metrics.\nAssuming the example OUD configuration in Create OUD instances, three OUD servers are started by default (oud-ds-rs-0, oud-ds-rs-1, oud-ds-rs-2).\nIn the following example an HPA resource is created, targeted at the statefulset oud-ds-rs. This resource will autoscale OUD servers from a minimum of 3 OUD servers up to 5 OUD servers. Scaling up will occur when the average CPU is consistently over 70%. Scaling down will occur when the average CPU is consistently below 70%.\n  Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa and create an autoscalehpa.yaml file that contains the following.\n# apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: oud-sts-hpa namespace: oudns spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: StatefulSet name: oud-ds-rs #statefulset name of oud behavior: scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 scaleUp: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 minReplicas: 3 maxReplicas: 5 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70 Note : minReplicas should match the number of OUD servers started by default. Set maxReplicas to the maximum amount of OUD servers that can be started.\nNote: To find the statefulset name, in this example oud-ds-rs, run \u0026ldquo;kubectl get statefulset -n oudns\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: For setting HPA based on Memory Metrics, update the metrics block with the following content. Please note we recommend using only CPU or Memory, not both.\nmetrics: - type: Resource resource: name: memory target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70   Run the following command to create the autoscaler:\n$ kubectl apply -f autoscalehpa.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/oud-sts-hpa created   Verify the status of the autoscaler by running the following:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE oud-sts-hpa StatefulSet/oud-ds-rs 5%/70% 3 5 3 33s In the example above, this shows that CPU is currently running at 5% for the oud-sts-hpa.\n  Testing HPA   Check the current status of the OUD servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h15m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h9m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h2m oud-pod-cron-job-28242120-bwtcz 0/1 Completed 0 61m oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 31m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 92s In the above oud-ds-rs-0, oud-ds-rs-0, oud-ds-rs-2 are running.\n  To test HPA can scale up the OUD servers, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty oud-ds-rs-0 -n oudns -- /bin/bash This will take you inside a bash shell inside the oud-ds-rs-0 pod:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ Inside the bash shell, run the following command to increase the load on the CPU:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null This command will continue to run in the foreground.\n  Repeat the step above for the oud-ds-rs-1 pod:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty oud-ds-rs-1 -n oudns -- /bin/bash [oracle@oud-ds-rs-1 oracle]$ [oracle@oud-ds-rs-1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null   In a command window outside the bash shells, run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE oud-sts-hpa StatefulSet/oud-ds-rs 125%/70% 3 5 3 5m15s In the above example the CPU has increased to 125%. As this is above the 70% limit, the autoscaler increases the replicas by starting additional OUD servers.\n  Run the following to see if any more OUD servers are started:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h50m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h44m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h37m oud-ds-rs-3 1/1 Running 0 9m29s oud-ds-rs-4 1/1 Running 0 5m17s oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 66m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 36m oud-pod-cron-job-28242210-kn7sv 0/1 Completed 0 6m28s In the example above one more OUD server has started (oud-ds-rs-4).\nNote: It may take some time for the server to appear and start. Once the server is at READY status of 1/1, the server is started.\n  To stop the load on the CPU, in both bash shells, issue a Control C, and then exit the bash shell:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null ^C [oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ exit   Run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE oud-sts-hpa StatefulSet/oud-ds-rs 4%/70% 3 5 5 40m In the above example CPU has dropped to 4%. As this is below the 70% threshold, you should see the autoscaler scale down the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h54m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h48m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h41m oud-ds-rs-3 1/1 Running 0 13m oud-ds-rs-4 1/1 Terminating 0 8m27s oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 70m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 40m oud-pod-cron-job-28242210-kn7sv 0/1 Completed 0 10m Eventually, the extra server will disappear:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h57m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h51m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h44m oud-ds-rs-3 1/1 Running 0 16m oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 73m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 43m oud-pod-cron-job-28242210-kn7sv 0/1 Completed 0 13m   Delete the HPA   If you need to delete the HPA, you can do so by running the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ kubectl delete -f autoscalehpa.yaml   Other considerations  If HPA is deployed and you need to upgrade the OUD image, then you must delete the HPA before upgrading. Once the upgrade is successful you can deploy HPA again. If you choose to scale up or scale down an OUD server manually as per Scaling Up/Down OUD Pods, then it is recommended to delete the HPA before doing so.  "

If the pod fails you can view the pod log using:\n$ kubectl logs -f oig-logstash-\u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oigns Most errors occur due to misconfiguration of the logstash_cm.yaml or logstash.yaml. This is usually because of an incorrect value set, or the certificate was not pasted with the correct indentation.\nIf the pod has errors, delete the pod and configmap as follows:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash.yaml $ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash_cm.yaml Once you have resolved the issue in the yaml files, run the commands outlined earlier to recreate the configmap and logstash pod.\n  Verify and access the Kibana console To access the Kibana console you will need the Kibana URL as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nFor Kibana 7.7.x and below:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Kibana \u0026gt; Index Patterns.\n  In the Create Index Pattern page enter oiglogs* for the Index pattern and click Next Step.\n  In the Configure settings page, from the Time Filter field name drop down menu select @timestamp and click Create index pattern.\n  Once the index pattern is created click on Discover in the navigation menu to view the OIG logs.\n  For Kibana version 7.8.X and above:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Stack Management.\n  Click Data Views in the Kibana section.\n  Click Create Data View and enter the following information:\n Name: oiglogs* Timestamp: @timestamp    Click Create Data View.\n  From the Navigation menu, click Discover to view the log file entries.\n  From the drop down menu, select oiglogs* to view the log file entries.\n  "

	"description": "Describes the steps for Monitoring the OAM domain.",
	"content": "After the OAM domain is set up you can monitor the OAM instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See Monitoring a domain.\nThe WebLogic Monitoring Exporter uses the WLS RESTful Management API to scrape runtime information and then exports Prometheus-compatible metrics. It is deployed as a web application in a WebLogic Server (WLS) instance, version 12.2.1 or later, typically, in the instance from which you want to get metrics.\nThere are two ways to setup monitoring and you should choose one method or the other:\n Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh Setup using manual configuration  Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh The $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/setup-monitoring.sh sets up the monitoring for the OAM domain. It installs Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and deploys the web applications to the OAM domain. It also deploys the WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard.\nFor usage details execute ./setup-monitoring.sh -h.\n  Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/monitoring-inputs.yaml and change the domainUID, domainNamespace, and weblogicCredentialsSecretName to correspond to your deployment. Also change wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster, wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster, exposeMonitoringNodePort to true. For example:\nversion: create-accessdomain-monitoring-inputs-v1 # Unique ID identifying your domain. # This ID must not contain an underscope (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), and must be lowercase and unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. domainUID: accessdomain # Name of the domain namespace domainNamespace: oamns # Boolean value indicating whether to install kube-prometheus-stack setupKubePrometheusStack: true # Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: # Name of the monitoring namespace monitoringNamespace: monitoring # Name of the Admin Server adminServerName: AdminServer # # Port number for admin server adminServerPort: 7001 # Cluster name oamClusterName: oam_cluster # Port number for managed server oamManagedServerPort: 14100 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster: true # Cluster name policyClusterName: policy_cluster # Port number for managed server policyManagedServerPort: 15100 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster: true # Boolean to indicate if the adminNodePort will be exposed exposeMonitoringNodePort: true # NodePort to expose Prometheus prometheusNodePort: 32101 # NodePort to expose Grafana grafanaNodePort: 32100 # NodePort to expose Alertmanager alertmanagerNodePort: 32102 # Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Admin Server's username and password weblogicCredentialsSecretName: accessdomain-credentials Note: For WDT domains, weblogicCredentialsSecretName should be set to accessdomain-weblogic-credentials.\nNote: If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana or prometheus, you must load the images in a local container registry. You must then set additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack to set the location of the image in your local container registry, for example:\n# Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set grafana.image.repository=container-registry.example.com/grafana --set grafana.image.tag=8.3.4   Run the following command to setup monitoring.\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./setup-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml The output should be similar to the following:\nMonitoring setup in monitoring in progress node/worker-node1 not labeled node/worker-node2 not labeled node/master-node not labeled Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack started \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; has been added to your repositories Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;appscode\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈ Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack in progress W0320 \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; 19121 warnings.go:70] policy/v1beta1 PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+ W0320 \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; 19121 warnings.go:70] policy/v1beta1 PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+ W0320 \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; 19121 warnings.go:70] policy/v1beta1 PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+ ..

Verify all the targets are mentioned.\n  Note : It may take several minutes for serviceMonitor/oamns/wls-exporter/0 to appear, so refresh the page until it does.\nGrafana dashboard   Access the Grafana dashboard with the following URL: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32100 and login with admin/admin. Change your password when prompted.\n  In the Dashboards panel, click on WebLogic Server Dashboard. The dashboard for your OAM domain should be displayed. If it is not displayed, click the Search icon in the left hand menu and search for WebLogic Server Dashboard.\n  Cleanup To uninstall the Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and the deployments, you can run the $WORKDIR/monitoring-service/kubernetes/delete-monitoring.sh script. For usage details execute ./delete-monitoring.sh -h.\n  To uninstall run the following command:\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./delete-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml $ kubectl delete namespace monitoring   Setup using manual configuration Install Prometheus, Grafana and WebLogic Monitoring Exporter manually. Create the web applications and deploy to the OAM domain.\nDeploy the Prometheus operator   Kube-Prometheus requires all nodes to be labelled with kubernetes.io/os=linux. To check if your nodes are labelled, run the following:\n$ kubectl get nodes --show-labels If the nodes are labelled the output will look similar to the following:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION LABELS worker-node1 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-node1,kubernetes.io/os=linux worker-node2 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-node2,kubernetes.io/os=linux master-node Ready master 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=master-node,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/master= If the nodes are not labelled, run the following command:\n$ kubectl label nodes --all kubernetes.io/os=linux   Clone Prometheus by running the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ git clone https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus.git -b v0.7.0 Note: Please refer the compatibility matrix of Kube Prometheus. Please download the release of the repository according to the Kubernetes version of your cluster.\n  If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana, you must load the images in a local container registry.\nFor grafana, edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus/manifests/grafana-deployment.yaml and change image: grafana/grafana:7.3.4 to your local container registry image location, for example image: container-registry.example.com/grafana/grafana:8.3.4.\nFor any other images check the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus/manifests/*deployment.yaml files.\n  Run the following command to create the namespace and custom resource definitions:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl create -f manifests/setup The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/monitoring created

The Prometheus Operator identifies the targets using service discovery. To get the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter end point discovered as a target, you must create a service monitor pointing to the service.\nThe exporting of metrics from wls-exporter requires basicAuth, so a Kubernetes Secret is created with the user name and password that are base64 encoded. This Secret is used in the ServiceMonitor deployment. The wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml has basicAuth with credentials as username: weblogic and password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; in base64 encoded.\n  Run the following command to get the base64 encoded version of the weblogic password:\n$ echo -n \u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | base64 The output will look similar to the following:\nV2VsY29tZTE=   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml and change the password: value to the value returned above. Also change the namespace: and weblogic.domainName: values to match your OAM namespace and domain name:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: basic-auth namespace: oamns data: password: V2VsY29tZTE= user: d2VibG9naWM= type: Opaque --- apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: wls-exporter namespace: oamns labels: k8s-app: wls-exporter release: monitoring spec: namespaceSelector: matchNames: - oamns selector: matchLabels: weblogic.domainName: accessdomain endpoints: - basicAuth: password: name: basic-auth key: password username: name: basic-auth key: user port: default relabelings: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) interval: 10s honorLabels: true path: /wls-exporter/metrics   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleSpecific-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OAM namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oamns rules: - apiGroups: - \u0026quot;\u0026quot; resources: - services - endpoints - pods verbs: - get - list - watch kind: RoleList   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleBinding-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OAM namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oamns roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: prometheus-k8s subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: prometheus-k8s namespace: monitoring kind: RoleBindingList   Run the following command to enable Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests $ kubectl apply -f . The output will look similar to the following:\nrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created secret/basic-auth created servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/wls-exporter created   Prometheus Service Discovery After the ServiceMonitor is deployed, the wls-exporter should be discovered by Prometheus and be able to collect metrics.\n  Access the following URL to view Prometheus service discovery: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32101/service-discovery\n  Click on oamns/wls-exporter/0  and then show more. Verify all the targets are mentioned.\n  Grafana Dashboard   Access the Grafana dashboard with the following URL: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32100 and login with admin/admin. Change your password when prompted.\n  Import the Grafana dashboard by navigating on the left hand menu to Create \u0026gt; Import. Copy the content from $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/config/weblogic-server-dashboard-import.json and paste. Then click Load and Import. The dashboard should be displayed in the Dashboards panel.\n  Cleanup To clean up a manual installation:\n  Run the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/ $ kubectl delete -f .   Delete the deployments:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/scripts/ $ kubectl cp undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:/u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy $ kubectl exec -it -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver -- /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh /u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy/undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py -domainName \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -adminServerName AdminServer -adminURL \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:7001 -username weblogic -password \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -oamClusterName oam_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster true -policyClusterName policy_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster true   Delete Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl delete -f manifests   "

	"content": " Prerequisite configuration Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server  Troubleshooting   Deploy HPA Testing HPA Delete the HPA Other considerations  Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is supported from Weblogic Kubernetes Operator 4.0.X and later.\nHPA allows automatic scaling (up and down) of the OAM Managed Servers. If load increases then extra OAM Managed Servers will be started as required, up to the value configuredManagedServerCount defined when the domain was created (see Prepare the create domain script). Similarly, if load decreases, OAM Managed Servers will be automatically shutdown.\nFor more information on HPA, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\nThe instructions below show you how to configure and run an HPA to scale an OAM cluster (accessdomain-oam-cluster) resource, based on CPU utilization or memory resource metrics. If required, you can also perform the following for the accessdomain-policy-cluster.\nNote: If you enable HPA and then decide you want to start/stop/scale OAM Managed servers manually as per Domain Life Cycle, it is recommended to delete HPA beforehand as per Delete the HPA.\nPrerequisite configuration In order to use HPA, the OAM domain must have been created with the required resources parameter as per Set the OAM server memory parameters. For example:\nserverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; If you created the OAM domain without setting these parameters, then you can update the domain using the following steps:\n  Run the following command to edit the cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster accessdomain-oam-cluster -n oamns Note: This opens an edit session for the oam-cluster where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oam_cluster. Change the entry so it looks as follows:\nspec: clusterName: oam_cluster replicas: 1 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: 8Gi requests: cpu: 1000m memory: 4Gi serverService: precreateService: true ...   Save the file and exit (:wq!)\nThe output will look similar to the following:\ncluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster edited The OAM Managed Server pods will then automatically be restarted.\n  Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server Before deploying HPA you must deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n  Check to see if the Kubernetes Metrics Server is already deployed:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric If a row is returned as follows, then Kubernetes Metric Server is deployed and you can move to Deploy HPA.\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 5m13s   If no rows are returned by the previous command, then the Kubernetes Metric Server needs to be deployed. Run the following commands to get the components.yaml:\n$ mkdir $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml   Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/metrics-server created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created service/metrics-server created deployment.apps/metrics-server created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created   Run the following command to check Kubernetes Metric Server is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric Make sure the pod has a READY status of 1/1:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 39s   Troubleshooting If the Kubernetes Metric Server does not reach the READY 1/1 state, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system $ kubectl logs \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system If you see errors such as:\nReadiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500 and:\nE0907 13:07:50.937308 1 scraper.go:140] \u0026quot;Failed to scrape node\u0026quot; err=\u0026quot;Get \\\u0026quot;https://100.105.18.113:10250/metrics/resource\\\u0026quot;: x509: cannot validate certificate for 100.105.18.113 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs\u0026quot; node=\u0026quot;worker-node1\u0026quot; then you may need to install a valid cluster certificate for your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor testing purposes, you can resolve this issue by:\n  Delete the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml   Edit the $WORKDIR/hpa/components.yaml and locate the args: section. Add kubelet-insecure-tls to the arguments. For example:\nspec: containers: - args: - --cert-dir=/tmp - --secure-port=4443 - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname - --kubelet-use-node-status-port - --kubelet-insecure-tls - --metric-resolution=15s image: registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.6.4 ...   Deploy the Kubenetes Metrics Server using the command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml Run the following and make sure the READY status shows 1/1:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric The output should look similar to the following:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 40s   Deploy HPA The steps below show how to configure and run an HPA to scale the accessdomain-oam-cluster, based on the CPU or memory utilization resource metrics.\nThe default OAM deployment creates the cluster accessdomain-oam-cluster which starts one OAM Managed Server (oam_server1). The deployment also creates, but doesn’t start, four extra OAM Managed Servers (oam-server2 to oam-server5).\nIn the following example an HPA resource is created, targeted at the cluster resource accessdomain-oam-cluster. This resource will autoscale OAM Managed Servers from a minimum of 1 cluster member up to 5 cluster members. Scaling up will occur when the average CPU is consistently over 70%. Scaling down will occur when the average CPU is consistently below 70%.\n  Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa and create an autoscalehpa.yaml file that contains the following.\n# apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa namespace: oamns spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v1 kind: Cluster name: accessdomain-oam-cluster behavior: scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 scaleUp: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 5 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70 Note : minReplicas and maxReplicas should match your current domain settings.\nNote: For setting HPA based on Memory Metrics, update the metrics block with the following content. Please note we recommend using only CPU or Memory, not both.\nmetrics: - type: Resource resource: name: memory target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70   Run the following command to create the autoscaler:\n$ kubectl apply -f autoscalehpa.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa created   Verify the status of the autoscaler by running the following:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa Cluster/accessdomain-oam-cluster 5%/70% 1 5 1 21s In the example above, this shows that CPU is currently running at 5% for the accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa.\n  Testing HPA   Check the current status of the OAM Managed Servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 0/1 Running 0 141m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-6br2j 0/1 Completed 0 5h19m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 0/1 Running 0 138m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 138m helper 1/1 Running 0 21h nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-5f9bdf4c9-f5trt 1/1 Running 0 4h33m In the above, only accessdomain-oam-server1 is running.\n  To test HPA can scale up the WebLogic cluster accessdomain-oam-cluster, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty accessdomain-oam-server1 -n oamns -- /bin/bash This will take you inside a bash shell inside the oam_server1 pod:\n[oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ Inside the bash shell, run the following command to increase the load on the CPU:\n[oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null This command will continue to run in the foreground.\n  In a command window outside the bash shell, run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa Cluster/accessdomain-oam-cluster 470%/70% 1 5 1 21s In the above example the CPU has increased to 470%. As this is above the 70% limit, the autoscaler increases the replicas on the Cluster resource and the operator responds by starting additional cluster members.\n  Run the following to see if any more OAM Managed Servers are started:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 0/1 Running 143m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-6br2j 0/1 Completed 0 5h21m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 0/1 Running 0 140m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 140m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3m20s accessdomain-oam-server3 1/1 Running 0 3m20s accessdomain-oam-server4 1/1 Running 0 3m19s accessdomain-oam-server5 1/1 Running 0 3m5s helper 1/1 Running 0 21h In the example above four more OAM Managed Servers have been started (oam-server2 - oam-server5).\nNote: It may take some time for the servers to appear and start. Once the servers are at READY status of 1/1, the servers are started.\n  To stop the load on the CPU, in the bash shell, issue a Control C, and then exit the bash shell:\n[oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null ^C [oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ exit   Run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa Cluster/accessdomain-oam-cluster 19%/70% 1 5 5 19m In the above example CPU has dropped to 19%. As this is below the 70% threshold, you should see the autoscaler scale down the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 152m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-6br2j 0/1 Completed 0 5h30m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 149m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 149m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 14m accessdomain-oam-server3 0/1 Terminating 0 14m helper 1/1 Running 0 21h nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-5f9bdf4c9-f5trt 1/1 Running 0 4h45m Eventually, all the servers except oam-server1 will disappear:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 154m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-6br2j 0/1 Completed 0 5h32m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 151m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 151m helper 1/1 Running 0 21h nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-5f9bdf4c9-f5trt 1/1 Running 0 4h47m   Delete the HPA   If you need to delete the HPA, you can do so by running the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ kubectl delete -f autoscalehpa.yaml   Other considerations  If HPA is deployed and you need to upgrade the OAM image, then you must delete the HPA before upgrading. Once the upgrade is successful you can deploy HPA again. If you choose to start/stop an OAM Managed Server manually as per Domain Life Cycle, then it is recommended to delete the HPA before doing so.  "

	"description": "Describes the steps for Monitoring the OIG domain and Publishing the logs to Elasticsearch.",
	"content": "After the OIG domain is set up you can monitor the OIG instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See Monitoring a domain.\nThe WebLogic Monitoring Exporter uses the WLS RESTful Management API to scrape runtime information and then exports Prometheus-compatible metrics. It is deployed as a web application in a WebLogic Server (WLS) instance, version 12.2.1 or later, typically, in the instance from which you want to get metrics.\nThere are two ways to setup monitoring and you should choose one method or the other:\n Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh Setup using manual configuration  Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh The $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/setup-monitoring.sh sets up the monitoring for the OIG domain. It installs Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and deploys the web applications to the OIG domain. It also deploys the WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard.\nFor usage details execute ./setup-monitoring.sh -h.\n  Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/monitoring-inputs.yaml and change the domainUID, domainNamespace, and weblogicCredentialsSecretName to correspond to your deployment. Also change wlsMonitoringExporterTosoaCluster, wlsMonitoringExporterTooimCluster, exposeMonitoringNodePort to true. For example:\nversion: create-governancedomain-monitoring-inputs-v1 # Unique ID identifying your domain. # This ID must not contain an underscope (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), and must be lowercase and unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. domainUID: governancedomain # Name of the domain namespace domainNamespace: oigns # Boolean value indicating whether to install kube-prometheus-stack setupKubePrometheusStack: true # Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: # Name of the monitoring namespace monitoringNamespace: monitoring # Name of the Admin Server adminServerName: AdminServer # # Port number for admin server adminServerPort: 7001 # Cluster name soaClusterName: soa_cluster # Port number for managed server soaManagedServerPort: 8001 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTosoaCluster: true # Cluster name oimClusterName: oim_cluster # Port number for managed server oimManagedServerPort: 14000 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTooimCluster: true # Boolean to indicate if the adminNodePort will be exposed exposeMonitoringNodePort: true # NodePort to expose Prometheus prometheusNodePort: 32101 # NodePort to expose Grafana grafanaNodePort: 32100 # NodePort to expose Alertmanager alertmanagerNodePort: 32102 # Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Admin Server's username and password weblogicCredentialsSecretName: oig-domain-credentials Note: For WDT domains, weblogicCredentialsSecretName should be set to governancedomain-weblogic-credentials.\nNote: If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana or prometheus, you must load the images in a local container registry. You must then set additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack to set the location of the image in your local container registry, for example:\n# Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set grafana.image.repository=container-registry.example.com/grafana --set grafana.image.tag=8.3.4   Run the following command to setup monitoring:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./setup-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml The output should be similar to the following:\nMonitoring setup in monitoring in progress node/worker-node1 not labeled node/worker-node2 not labeled node/master-node not labeled Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack started \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; already exists with the same configuration, skipping Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈ Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack in progress NAME: monitoring LAST DEPLOYED: \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; NAMESPACE: monitoring STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 NOTES: kube-prometheus-stack has been installed.

Create the web applications and deploy to the OIG domain.\nDeploy the Prometheus operator   Kube-Prometheus requires all nodes to be labelled with kubernetes.io/os=linux. To check if your nodes are labelled, run the following:\n$ kubectl get nodes --show-labels If the nodes are labelled the output will look similar to the following:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION LABELS worker-node1 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-node1,kubernetes.io/os=linux worker-node2 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-node2,kubernetes.io/os=linux master-node Ready master 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=master-node,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/master= If the nodes are not labelled, run the following command:\n$ kubectl label nodes --all kubernetes.io/os=linux   Clone Prometheus by running the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ git clone https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus.git -b v0.7.0 Note: Please refer the compatibility matrix of Kube Prometheus. Please download the release of the repository according to the Kubernetes version of your cluster.\n  If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana, you must load the images in a local container registry.\nFor grafana, edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus/manifests/grafana-deployment.yaml and change image: grafana/grafana:7.3.4 to your local container registry image location, for example image: container-registry.example.com/grafana/grafana:8.3.4.\nFor any other images check the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus/manifests/*deployment.yaml files.\n  Run the following command to create the namespace and custom resource definitions:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl create -f manifests/setup The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/monitoring created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/probes.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/thanosrulers.monitoring.coreos.com created Warning: spec.template.spec.nodeSelector[beta.kubernetes.io/os]: deprecated since v1.14;

The Prometheus Operator identifies the targets using service discovery. To get the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter end point discovered as a target, you must create a service monitor pointing to the service.\nThe exporting of metrics from wls-exporter requires basicAuth, so a Kubernetes Secret is created with the user name and password that are base64 encoded. This Secret is used in the ServiceMonitor deployment. The wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml has basicAuth with credentials as username: weblogic and password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; in base64 encoded.\n  Run the following command to get the base64 encoded version of the weblogic password:\n$ echo -n \u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | base64 The output will look similar to the following:\nV2VsY29tZTE=   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml and change the password: value to the value returned above. Also change any reference to the namespace and weblogic.domainName: values to match your OIG namespace and domain name. For example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: basic-auth namespace: oigns data: password: V2VsY29tZTE= user: d2VibG9naWM= type: Opaque --- apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: wls-exporter namespace: oigns labels: k8s-app: wls-exporter release: monitoring spec: namespaceSelector: matchNames: - oigns selector: matchLabels: weblogic.domainName: governancedomain endpoints: - basicAuth: password: name: basic-auth key: password username: name: basic-auth key: user port: default relabelings: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) interval: 10s honorLabels: true path: /wls-exporter/metrics   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleSpecific-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OIG namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oigns rules: - apiGroups: - \u0026quot;\u0026quot; resources: - services - endpoints - pods verbs: - get - list - watch kind: RoleList   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleBinding-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OIG namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oigns roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: prometheus-k8s subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: prometheus-k8s namespace: monitoring kind: RoleBindingList   Run the following command to enable Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests $ kubectl apply -f . The output will look similar to the following:\nrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created secret/basic-auth created servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/wls-exporter created   Prometheus service discovery After the ServiceMonitor is deployed, the wls-exporter should be discovered by Prometheus and be able to collect metrics.\n  Access the following URL to view Prometheus service discovery: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32101/service-discovery\n  Click on oigns/wls-exporter/0 and then show more. Verify all the targets are mentioned.\n  Note: It may take several minutes for oigns/wls-exporter/0 to appear, so refresh the page until it does.\nGrafana dashboard   Access the Grafana dashboard with the following URL: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32100 and login with admin/admin. Change your password when prompted.\n  Import the Grafana dashboard by navigating on the left hand menu to Create \u0026gt; Import. Copy the content from $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/config/weblogic-server-dashboard-import.json and paste. Then click Load and Import. The dashboard should be displayed.\n  Cleanup To clean up a manual installation:\n  Run the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/ $ kubectl delete -f .   Delete the deployments:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/scripts/ $ kubectl cp undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:/u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy $ kubectl exec -it -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver -- /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh /u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy/undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py -domainName \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -adminServerName AdminServer -adminURL \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:7001 -username weblogic -password \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -oimClusterName oim_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTooimCluster true -soaClusterName soa_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTosoaCluster true   Delete Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl delete -f manifests $ kubectl delete -f manifests/setup   "

	"content": " Prerequisite configuration Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server  Troubleshooting   Deploy HPA Testing HPA Delete the HPA Other considerations  Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is supported from Weblogic Kubernetes Operator 4.0.X and later.\nHPA allows automatic scaling (up and down) of the OIG Managed Servers. If load increases then extra OIG Managed Servers will be started as required, up to the value configuredManagedServerCount defined when the domain was created (see Prepare the create domain script). Similarly, if load decreases, OIG Managed Servers will be automatically shutdown.\nFor more information on HPA, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\nThe instructions below show you how to configure and run an HPA to scale an OIG cluster (governancedomain-oim-cluster) resource, based on CPU utilization or memory resource metrics. If required, you can also perform the following for the governancedomain-soa-cluster.\nNote: If you enable HPA and then decide you want to start/stop/scale OIG Managed servers manually as per Domain Life Cycle, it is recommended to delete HPA beforehand as per Delete the HPA.\nPrerequisite configuration In order to use HPA, the OIG domain must have been created with the required resources parameter as per Set the OIM server memory parameters. For example:\nserverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; If you created the OIG domain without setting these parameters, then you can update the domain using the following steps:\n  Run the following command to edit the cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster -n oigns Note: This opens an edit session for the governancedomain-oim-cluster where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oim_cluster. Change the entry so it looks as follows:\nspec: clusterName: oim_cluster replicas: 1 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: 8Gi requests: cpu: 1000m memory: 4Gi serverService: precreateService: true ...   Save the file and exit (:wq!)\nThe output will look similar to the following:\ncluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster edited The OIG Managed Server pods will then automatically be restarted.\n  Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server Before deploying HPA you must deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n  Check to see if the Kubernetes Metrics Server is already deployed:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric If a row is returned as follows, then Kubernetes Metric Server is deployed and you can move to Deploy HPA.\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 5m13s   If no rows are returned by the previous command, then the Kubernetes Metric Server needs to be deployed. Run the following commands to get the components.yaml:\n$ mkdir $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml   Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/metrics-server created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created service/metrics-server created deployment.apps/metrics-server created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created   Run the following command to check Kubernetes Metric Server is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric Make sure the pod has a READY status of 1/1:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 39s   Troubleshooting If the Kubernetes Metric Server does not reach the READY 1/1 state, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system $ kubectl logs \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system If you see errors such as:\nReadiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500 and:\nE0907 13:07:50.937308 1 scraper.go:140] \u0026quot;Failed to scrape node\u0026quot; err=\u0026quot;Get \\\u0026quot;https://100.105.18.113:10250/metrics/resource\\\u0026quot;: x509: cannot validate certificate for 100.105.18.113 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs\u0026quot; node=\u0026quot;worker-node1\u0026quot; then you may need to install a valid cluster certificate for your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor testing purposes, you can resolve this issue by:\n  Delete the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml   Edit the $WORKDIR/hpa/components.yaml and locate the args: section. Add kubelet-insecure-tls to the arguments. For example:\nspec: containers: - args: - --cert-dir=/tmp - --secure-port=4443 - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname - --kubelet-use-node-status-port - --kubelet-insecure-tls - --metric-resolution=15s image: registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.6.4 ...   Deploy the Kubenetes Metrics Server using the command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml Run the following and make sure the READY status shows 1/1:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric The output should look similar to the following:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 40s   Deploy HPA The steps below show how to configure and run an HPA to scale the governancedomain-oim-cluster, based on the CPU or memory utilization resource metrics.\nThe default OIG deployment creates the cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster which starts one OIG Managed Server (oim_server1). The deployment also creates, but doesn’t start, four extra OIG Managed Servers (oim-server2 to oim-server5).\nIn the following example an HPA resource is created, targeted at the cluster resource governancedomain-oim-cluster. This resource will autoscale OIG Managed Servers from a minimum of 1 cluster member up to 5 cluster members. Scaling up will occur when the average CPU is consistently over 70%. Scaling down will occur when the average CPU is consistently below 70%.\n  Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa and create an autoscalehpa.yaml file that contains the following.\n# apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa namespace: oigns spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v1 kind: Cluster name: governancedomain-oim-cluster behavior: scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 scaleUp: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 5 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70 Note : minReplicas and maxReplicas should match your current domain settings.\nNote: For setting HPA based on Memory Metrics, update the metrics block with the following content. Please note we recommend using only CPU or Memory, not both.\nmetrics: - type: Resource resource: name: memory target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70   Run the following command to create the autoscaler:\n$ kubectl apply -f autoscalehpa.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa created   Verify the status of the autoscaler by running the following:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa Cluster/governancedomain-oim-cluster 16%/70% 1 5 1 20s In the example above, this shows that CPU is currently running at 16% for the governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa.\n  Testing HPA   Check the current status of the OIG Managed Servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 20m governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8wd2b 0/1 Completed 0 2d18h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 17m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 17m helper 1/1 Running 0 2d18h In the above only governancedomain-oim-server1 is running.\n  To test HPA can scale up the WebLogic cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty governancedomain-oim-server1 -n oigns -- /bin/bash This will take you inside a bash shell inside the oim_server1 pod:\n[oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ Inside the bash shell, run the following command to increase the load on the CPU:\n[oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null This command will continue to run in the foreground.\n  In a command window outside the bash shell, run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa Cluster/governancedomain-oim-cluster 386%/70% 1 5 1 2m47s In the above example the CPU has increased to 386%. As this is above the 70% limit, the autoscaler increases the replicas on the Cluster resource and the operator responds by starting additional cluster members.\n  Run the following to see if any more OIG Managed Servers are started:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 30m governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8wd2b 0/1 Completed 0 2d18h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 27m governancedomain-oim-server2 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-oim-server3 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-oim-server4 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-oim-server5 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 27m helper 1/1 Running 0 2d18h In the example above four more OIG Managed Servers have been started (oim-server2 - oim-server5).\nNote: It may take some time for the servers to appear and start. Once the servers are at READY status of 1/1, the servers are started.\n  To stop the load on the CPU, in the bash shell, issue a Control C, and then exit the bash shell:\n[oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null ^C [oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ exit   Run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa Cluster/governancedomain-oim-cluster 33%/70% 1 5 5 37m In the above example CPU has dropped to 33%. As this is below the 70% threshold, you should see the autoscaler scale down the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 43m governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8wd2b 0/1 Completed 0 2d18h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 40m governancedomain-oim-server2 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server3 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server4 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server5 0/1 Terminating 0 13m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 40m helper 1/1 Running 0 2d19h Eventually, all the servers except oim-server1 will disappear:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 44m governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8wd2b 0/1 Completed 0 2d18h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 41m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 41m helper 1/1 Running 0 2d20h   Delete the HPA   If you need to delete the HPA, you can do so by running the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ kubectl delete -f autoscalehpa.yaml   Other considerations  If HPA is deployed and you need to upgrade the OIG image, then you must delete the HPA before upgrading. Once the upgrade is successful you can deploy HPA again. If you choose to start/stop an OIG Managed Server manually as per Domain Life Cycle, then it is recommended to delete the HPA before doing so.  "
