Only configured clusters are supported. Dynamic clusters are not supported for OAM domains. Note that you can still use all of the scaling features, but you need to define the maximum size of your cluster at domain creation time, using the parameter configuredManagedServerCount. For more details on this parameter, see Prepare the create domain script. It is recommended to pre-configure your cluster so it\u0026rsquo;s sized a little larger than the maximum size you plan to expand it to. You must rigorously test at this maximum size to make sure that your system can scale as expected. The WebLogic Monitoring Exporter currently supports the WebLogic MBean trees only.

Before you can use this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oam_cpu and accept the license agreement.\n  If using your own container registry to store the OAM container image, this is the username and password (or token) for your container registry.\n  The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/orclcred created   Create OAM Domains Using WDT Models If you want to create an OAM domain using WDT models, ignore everything else on this page and move directly to Create OAM Domains Using WDT Models.\nCreate OAM Domains Using WLST Scripts If you want to create an OAM domain using WLST scripts, follow the rest of the instructions below.\na. RCU schema creation\nb. Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU\nc.

A Kubernetes persistent volume is an arbitrary name (determined in this case, by Oracle) that is mapped to a physical volume on a disk.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\nTo create a Kubernetes persistent volume, perform the following steps:\n  Make a backup copy of the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and create required directories:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Navigate to $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc and edit the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and update the following parameters to reflect your settings. Save the file when complete:\nbaseName: \u0026lt;domain\u0026gt; domainUID: \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; namespace: \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; weblogicDomainStorageType: NFS weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer: \u0026lt;nfs_server\u0026gt;

The image can be obtained in the following ways:\n Prebuilt OIG container image Build your own OIG container image using WebLogic Image Tool  Prebuilt OIG container image The latest prebuilt OIG July 2024 container image can be downloaded from Oracle Container Registry. This image is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle Identity Governance 12.2.1.4.0, the July Patch Set Update (PSU) and other fixes released with the Critical Patch Update (CPU) program..\nNote: Before using this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oig_cpu and accept the license agreement.\nYou can use this image in the following ways:\n Pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry automatically during the OIG Kubernetes deployment. Manually pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry and then upload it to your own container registry. Manually pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry and manually stage it on the master node and each worker node.  Build your own OIG container image using WebLogic Image Tool You can build your own OIG container image using the WebLogic Image Tool. This is recommended if you need to apply one off patches to a Prebuilt OIG container image. For more information about building your own container image with WebLogic Image Tool, see Create or update image.\nYou can use an image built with WebLogic Image Tool in the following ways:\n Manually upload them to your own container registry. Manually stage them on the master node and each worker node.  Note: This documentation does not tell you how to pull or push the above images into a private container registry, or stage them on the master and worker nodes. Details of this can be found in the Enterprise Deployment Guide.\nSetup the code repository to deploy OIG domains Oracle Identity Governance domain deployment on Kubernetes leverages the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator infrastructure. For deploying the OIG domains, you need to set up the deployment scripts on the master node as below:\n  Create a working directory to setup the source code.\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/OIGK8S   Download the latest OIG deployment scripts from the OIG repository.\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/24.3.1 For example:\n$ cd /scratch/OIGK8S $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/24.3.1   Set the $WORKDIR environment variable as follows:\n$ export WORKDIR=\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance For example:\n$ export WORKDIR=/scratch/OIGK8S/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance   Run the following command and see if the WebLogic custom resource definition name already exists:\n$ kubectl get crd In the output you should see:\nNo resources found in default namespace. If you see any of the following:\nNAME AGE clusters.weblogic.oracle 5d domains.weblogic.oracle 5d then run the following command to delete the existing crd\u0026rsquo;s:\n$ kubectl delete crd clusters.weblogic.oracle $ kubectl delete crd domains.weblogic.oracle   Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator   On the master node run the following command to create a namespace for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/opns created   Create a service account for the operator in the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace by running the following command:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-sa\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/op-sa created   Run the following helm command to install and start the operator:\n$ cd $WORKDIR $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; \\ --set image=ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:4.1.8 \\ --set serviceAccount=\u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-sa\u0026gt; \\ --set “enableClusterRoleBinding=true” \\ --set \u0026#34;domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy=LabelSelector\u0026#34;

\\ --set \u0026#34;domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy=LabelSelector\u0026#34; \\ --set \u0026#34;domainNamespaceLabelSelector=weblogic-operator\\=enabled\u0026#34; \\ --set \u0026#34;javaLoggingLevel=FINE\u0026#34; --wait The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME: weblogic-kubernetes-operator LAST DEPLOYED: \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; NAMESPACE: opns STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None   Verify that the operator\u0026rsquo;s pod and services are running by executing the following command:\n$ kubectl get all -n \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get all -n opns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/weblogic-operator-b7d6df78c-vxnpt 1/1 Running 0 33s pod/weblogic-operator-webhook-7996b8b58b-68l8s 1/1 Running 0 33s NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/weblogic-operator-webhook-svc ClusterIP 10.109.163.130 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt;

Status: Active No resource quota. No LimitRange resource.   Create a Kubernetes secret for the container registry In this section you create a secret that stores the credentials for the container registry where the OIG image is stored.\nIf you are not using a container registry and have loaded the images on each of the master and worker nodes, then there is no need to create the registry secret.\n  Run the following command to create the secret:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026lt;CONTAINER_REGISTRY\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;EMAIL_ID\u0026gt; \\ --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example, if using Oracle Container Registry:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;user@example.com\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oigns Replace \u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; with the credentials for the registry with the following caveats:\n  If using Oracle Container Registry to pull the OIG container image, this is the username and password used to login to Oracle Container Registry. Before you can use this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oig_cpu and accept the license agreement.\n  If using your own container registry to store the OIG container image, this is the username and password (or token) for your container registry.\n  The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/orclcred created   Create OIG Domains Using WDT Models If you want to create an OIG domain using WDT models, ignore everything else on this page and move directly to Create OIG Domains Using WDT Models.\nCreate OIG Domains Using WLST Scripts If you want to create an OIG domain using WLST scripts, follow the rest of the instructions below.\na. RCU schema creation\nb. Creating Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU\nc. Create a Kubernetes persistent volume and persistent volume claim\nRCU schema creation In this section you create the RCU schemas in the Oracle Database.\nBefore following the steps in this section, make sure that the database and listener are up and running and you can connect to the database via SQL*Plus or other client tool.\n  If using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OIG container image, run the following command to create a helper pod to run RCU:\n$ kubectl run --image=\u0026lt;image_name-from-registry\u0026gt; --image-pull-policy=\u0026#34;IfNotPresent\u0026#34; --overrides=\u0026#39;{\u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spec\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;imagePullSecrets\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34;}]}}\u0026#39; helper -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -- sleep infinity For example:\n$ kubectl run --image=container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July`24\u0026gt; --image-pull-policy=\u0026#34;IfNotPresent\u0026#34; --overrides=\u0026#39;{\u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;spec\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;imagePullSecrets\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34;}]}}\u0026#39; helper -n oigns -- sleep infinity If you are not using a container registry and have loaded the image on each of the master and worker nodes, run the following command:\n$ kubectl run helper --image \u0026lt;image\u0026gt; -n oigns -- sleep infinity For example:\n$ kubectl run helper --image oracle/oig:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July`24\u0026gt; -n oigns -- sleep infinity The output will look similar to the following:\npod/helper created   Run the following command to check the pod is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE helper 1/1 Running 0 3m Note: If you are pulling the image from a container registry it may take several minutes before the pod has a STATUS of 1\\1. While the pod is starting you can check the status of the pod, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl describe pod helper -n oigns   Run the following command to start a bash shell in the helper pod:\n$ kubectl exec -it helper -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -- /bin/bash For example:\n$ kubectl exec -it helper -n oigns -- /bin/bash This will take you into a bash shell in the running helper pod:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$   In the helper bash shell run the following commands to set the environment:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_HOST=\u0026lt;db_host.domain\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_PORT=\u0026lt;db_port\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_SERVICE=\u0026lt;service_name\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCUPREFIX=\u0026lt;rcu_schema_prefix\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCU_SCHEMA_PWD=\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ echo -e \u0026lt;db_pwd\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; \u0026gt; /tmp/pwd.txt [oracle@helper oracle]$ cat /tmp/pwd.txt where:\n\u0026lt;db_host.domain\u0026gt; is the database server hostname\n\u0026lt;db_port\u0026gt; is the database listener port\n\u0026lt;service_name\u0026gt; is the database service name\n\u0026lt;rcu_schema_prefix\u0026gt; is the RCU schema prefix you want to set\n\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; is the password you want to set for the \u0026lt;rcu_schema_prefix\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;db_pwd\u0026gt; is the SYS password for the database\nFor example:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_HOST=mydatabasehost.example.com [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_PORT=1521 [oracle@helper oracle]$ export DB_SERVICE=orcl.example.com [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCUPREFIX=OIGK8S [oracle@helper oracle]$ export RCU_SCHEMA_PWD=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; [oracle@helper oracle]$ echo -e \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \u0026gt; /tmp/pwd.txt [oracle@helper oracle]$ cat /tmp/pwd.txt \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;   In the helper bash shell run the following commands to create the RCU schemas in the database:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ /u01/oracle/oracle_common/bin/rcu -silent -createRepository -databaseType ORACLE -connectString \\ $DB_HOST:$DB_PORT/$DB_SERVICE -dbUser sys -dbRole sysdba -useSamePasswordForAllSchemaUsers true \\ -selectDependentsForComponents true -schemaPrefix $RCUPREFIX -component OIM -component MDS -component SOAINFRA -component OPSS \\ -f \u0026lt; /tmp/pwd.txt The output will look similar to the following:\nRCU Logfile: /tmp/RCU\u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt;/logs/rcu.log Processing command line ....

A Kubernetes persistent volume is an arbitrary name (determined in this case, by Oracle) that is mapped to a physical volume on a disk.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\n  Make a backup copy of the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and create required directories:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv touch file.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Navigate to $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc and edit the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and update the following parameters to reflect your settings.

This step must be followed if using Oracle Container Registry or your own private container registry. If you are not using a container registry and have loaded the images on each of the master and worker nodes, you can skip this step.\n  Run the following command to create the secret:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026lt;CONTAINER_REGISTRY\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;EMAIL_ID\u0026gt; \\ --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example, if using Oracle Container Registry:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;user@example.com\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oudns Replace \u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; with the credentials for the registry with the following caveats:\n  If using Oracle Container Registry to pull the OUD container image, this is the username and password used to login to Oracle Container Registry.

The pod(s) will then remain in that state forever. To avoid this problem a cron-job is created during OUD deployment that checks for any pods in Terminating state. If there are any pods in Terminating state, the cron job will delete them. The pods will then start again automatically. This cron job requires access to images on hub.docker.com. A Kubernetes secret must therefore be created to enable access to these images.\n  Create a Kubernetes secret to access the required images on hub.docker.com:\nNote: You must first have a user account on hub.docker.com:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;dockercred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026#34;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026#34; --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;docker_username\u0026gt;\u0026#34; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;docker_email_credentials\u0026gt; --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026quot;dockercred\u0026quot; --docker-server=\u0026quot;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026quot; --docker-username=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=user@example.com --namespace=oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/dockercred created   The oud-ds-rs Helm chart The oud-ds-rs Helm chart allows you to create or deploy a group of replicated Oracle Unified Directory instances along with Kubernetes objects in a specified namespace.\nThe deployment can be initiated by running the following Helm command with reference to the oud-ds-rs Helm chart, along with configuration parameters according to your environment.\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm $ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Configuration Parameters\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Helm Chart Path/Name\u0026gt; Configuration Parameters (override values in chart) can be passed on with --set arguments on the command line and/or with -f / --values arguments when referring to files.\nNote: The examples in Create OUD instances below provide values which allow the user to override the default values provided by the Helm chart.

If storageClassCreate: true it is recommended to set storageClass to a value of your choice, and provisioner to the provisioner supported by your cloud vendor. If you have an existing storageClass that supports network storage, set storageClassCreate: false and storageClass to the NAME value returned in \u0026ldquo;kubectl get storageclass\u0026rdquo;. The provisioner can be ignored.    If using Block Device storage for your persistent volume then change the persistence section as follows:\nNote: If you want to use block devices you should ensure that you have a default Kubernetes storage class defined for your environment that allows dynamic storage.

If you have an existing storageClass that supports dynamic storage, set storageClassCreate: false and storageClass to the NAME value returned in \u0026ldquo;kubectl get storageclass\u0026rdquo;. The provisioner can be ignored.    For resources, limits and requests, the example CPU and memory values shown are for development environments only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\n  If you plan on integrating OUD with other Oracle components then you must specify the following under the oudConfig: section:\n integration: \u0026lt;Integration option\u0026gt;  For example: oudConfig: etc... integration: \u0026lt;Integration option\u0026gt;  It is recommended to choose the option covering your minimal requirements. Allowed values include: `no-integration` (no integration), `basic` (Directory Integration Platform), `generic` (Directory Integration Platform, Database Net Services and E-Business Suite integration), `eus` (Directory Integration Platform, Database Net Services, E-Business Suite and Enterprise User Security integration).

If you are not using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OUD container image, then you can remove the following: --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=\u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot;.\n  For resources, limits and `requests1, the example CPU and memory values shown are for development environments only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\n  If you plan on integrating OUD with other Oracle components then you must specify the following:\n--set oudConfig.integration=\u0026lt;Integration option\u0026gt;  It is recommended to choose the option covering your minimal requirements. Allowed values include: `no-integration` (no integration), `basic` (Directory Integration Platform), `generic` (Directory Integration Platform, Database Net Services and E-Business Suite integration), `eus` (Directory Integration Platform, Database Net Services, E-Business Suite and Enterprise User Security integration). The default value is `no-integration` **Note**: This will enable the integration type only. To integrate OUD with the Oracle component referenced, refer to the relevant product component documentation.   If you want to enable Assured Replication, see Enabling Assured Replication (Optional).\n    Check the OUD deployment as per Verify the OUD deployment and Verify the OUD replication.\n  Enabling Assured Replication (Optional) If you want to enable assured replication, perform the following steps:\n  Create a directory on the persistent volume as follows:\n$ cd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt; $ mkdir oud-repl-config $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 oud-repl-config For example:\n$ cd /scratch/shared $ mkdir oud-repl-config $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 oud-repl-config   Add the following section in the oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml:\nreplOUD: envVars: - name: post_dsreplication_dsconfig_3 value: set-replication-domain-prop --domain-name ${baseDN} --advanced --set assured-type:safe-data --set assured-sd-level:2 --set assured-timeout:5s - name: execCmd_1 value: /u01/oracle/user_projects/${OUD_INSTANCE_NAME}/OUD/bin/dsconfig --no-prompt --hostname ${sourceHost} --port ${adminConnectorPort} --bindDN \u0026quot;${rootUserDN}\u0026quot; --bindPasswordFile /u01/oracle/user_projects/${OUD_INSTANCE_NAME}/admin/rootPwdFile.txt --trustAll set-replication-domain-prop --domain-name ${baseDN} --advanced --set assured-type:safe-data --set assured-sd-level:2 --set assured-timeout:5s --provider-name \u0026quot;Multimaster Synchronization\u0026quot; configVolume: enabled: true type: networkstorage storageClassCreate: true storageClass: oud-config provisioner: kubernetes.io/is-default-class networkstorage: nfs: server: \u0026lt;IP_address\u0026gt; path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oud-repl-config mountPath: /u01/oracle/config-input The above will enable assured replication with assured type safe-data and assured-sd-level: 2.\nNote: If you prefer assured-type to be set to safe-read, then change to --set assured-type:safe-read and remove --set assured-sd-level:2.\nFor more information on OUD Assured Replication, and other options and levels, see, Understanding the Oracle Unified Directory Replication Model.\nThe following caveats exist:\n  post_dsreplication_dsconfig_N and execCmd_N should be a unique key - change the suffix accordingly. For more information on the environment variable and respective keys, see, Appendix B: Environment Variables.\n  For configVolume the storage can be networkstorage(nfs) or filesystem(hostPath) as the config volume path has to be accessible from all the Kuberenetes nodes. Please note that block storage is not supported for configVolume.\n  If you want to create your own storage class, set storageClassCreate: true. If storageClassCreate: true it is recommended to set storageClass to a value of your choice, and provisioner to the provisioner supported by your cloud vendor.\n  * If you have an existing storageClass that supports network storage, set `storageClassCreate: false` and `storageClass` to the NAME value returned in \u0026quot;`kubectl get storageclass`\u0026quot;. Please note that the storage-class should not be the one you used for the persistent volume earlier. The `provisioner` can be ignored.

This step must be followed if using Oracle Container Registry or your own private container registry. If you are not using a container registry and have loaded the images on each of the master and worker nodes, you can skip this step.\n  Run the following command to create the secret:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026lt;CONTAINER_REGISTRY\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;EMAIL_ID\u0026gt; \\ --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example, if using Oracle Container Registry:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026#34;user@example.com\u0026#34; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oudsmns Replace \u0026lt;USER_NAME\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PASSWORD\u0026gt; with the credentials for the registry with the following caveats:\n  If using Oracle Container Registry to pull the OUDSM container image, this is the username and password used to login to Oracle Container Registry. Before you can use this image you must login to Oracle Container Registry, navigate to Middleware \u0026gt; oudsm_cpu and accept the license agreement.\n  If using your own container registry to store the OUDSM container image, this is the username and password (or token) for your container registry.\n  The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/orclcred created   Create a persistent volume directory As referenced in Prerequisites the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must have access to a persistent volume such as a Network File System (NFS) mount or a shared file system.\nIn this example /scratch/shared/ is a shared directory accessible from all nodes.\n  On the master node run the following command to create a user_projects directory:\n$ cd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt; $ mkdir oudsm_user_projects $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 oudsm_user_projects For example:\n$ cd /scratch/shared $ mkdir oudsm_user_projects $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 oudsm_user_projects   On the master node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\n$ cd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects $ touch file.txt $ ls filemaster.txt For example:\n$ cd /scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects $ touch filemaster.txt $ ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\n$ cd /scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects $ ls filemaster.txt $ touch fileworker1.txt $ ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  The oudsm Helm chart The oudsm Helm chart allows you to create or deploy Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager instances along with Kubernetes objects in a specified namespace.\nThe deployment can be initiated by running the following Helm command with reference to the oudsm Helm chart, along with configuration parameters according to your environment.\ncd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm $ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Configuration Parameters\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Helm Chart Path/Name\u0026gt; Configuration Parameters (override values in chart) can be passed on with --set arguments on the command line and/or with -f / --values arguments when referring to files.\nNote: The examples in Create OUDSM instances below provide values which allow the user to override the default values provided by the Helm chart. A full list of configuration parameters and their default values is shown in Appendix: Configuration parameters.\nFor more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help.\nCreate OUDSM instances You can create OUDSM instances using one of the following methods:\n Using a YAML file Using --set argument  Using a YAML file   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm   Create an oudsm-values-override.yaml as follows:\nimage: repository: \u0026lt;image_location\u0026gt; tag: \u0026lt;image_tag\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred oudsm: adminUser: weblogic adminPass: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects For example:\nimage: repository: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oudsm_cpu tag: 12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July\u0026#39;24\u0026gt; pullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred oudsm: adminUser: weblogic adminPass: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: /scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects The following caveats exist:\n  Replace \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; with a the relevant passwords.\n  If you are not using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OUD container image, then you can remove the following:\nimagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred   If using NFS for your persistent volume the change the persistence section as follows:\n  persistence: type: networkstorage networkstorage: nfs: path: \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects server: \u0026lt;NFS IP address\u0026gt;   Run the following command to deploy OUDSM:\n$ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ --values oudsm-values-override.yaml \\ \u0026lt;release_name\u0026gt; oudsm $ helm install --namespace oudsmns \\ --values oudsm-values-override.yaml \\ oudsm oudsm   Check the OUDSM deployment as per Verify the OUDSM deployment\n  Using --set argument   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm   Run the following command to create OUDSM instance:\n$ helm install --namespace oudsmns \\ --set oudsm.adminUser=weblogic,oudsm.adminPass=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;,persistence.filesystem.hostPath.path=\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects,image.repository=\u0026lt;image_location\u0026gt;,image.tag=\u0026lt;image_tag\u0026gt; \\ --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=\u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; \\ \u0026lt;release_name\u0026gt; oudsm For example:\n$ helm install --namespace oudsmns \\ --set oudsm.adminUser=weblogic,oudsm.adminPass=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;,persistence.filesystem.hostPath.path=/scratch/shared/oudsm_user_projects,image.repository=container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oudsm_cpu,image.tag=12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July\u0026#39;24\u0026gt; \\ --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=\u0026#34;orclcred\u0026#34; \\ oudsm oudsm The following caveats exist:\n Replace \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; with a the relevant password. If you are not using Oracle Container Registry or your own container registry for your OUDSM container image, then you can remove the following: --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=\u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot; If using using NFS for your persistent volume then use persistence.networkstorage.nfs.path=\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/oudsm_user_projects,persistence.networkstorage.nfs.server:\u0026lt;NFS IP address\u0026gt;.

It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available. You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace mynginx get services -o wide -w lbr-nginx-ingress-nginx-controller' An example Ingress that makes use of the controller: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: example namespace: foo spec: ingressClassName: nginx rules: - host: www.example.com http: paths: - pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: exampleService port: number: 80 path: / # This section is only required if TLS is to be enabled for the Ingress tls: - hosts: - www.example.com secretName: example-tls If TLS is enabled for the Ingress, a Secret containing the certificate and key must also be provided: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: example-tls namespace: foo data: tls.crt: \u0026lt;base64 encoded cert\u0026gt; tls.key: \u0026lt;base64 encoded key\u0026gt; type: kubernetes.io/tls   Access to interfaces through ingress Using the Helm chart, ingress objects are created according to configuration. The following table details the rules configured in ingress object(s) for access to Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Interfaces through ingress.\n   Port NodePort Host Example Hostname Path Backend Service:Port Example Service Name:Port     http/https 30080/30443 \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt;-N oudsm-N * \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt;-N:http oudsm-1:http   http/https 30080/30443 * * /oudsm/console \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt;-lbr:http oudsm-lbr:http     In the table above, the Example Name for each Object is based on the value \u0026lsquo;oudsm\u0026rsquo; as the deployment/release name for the Helm chart installation. The NodePorts mentioned in the table are according to ingress configuration described in previous section. When an External LoadBalancer is not available/configured, interfaces can be accessed through NodePort on the Kubernetes node.  Changes in /etc/hosts to validate hostname based ingress rules If it is not possible to have LoadBalancer configuration updated to have host names added for Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Interfaces, then the following entries can be added in /etc/hosts files on the host from where Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager interfaces would be accessed.\n\u0026lt;IP Address of External LBR or Kubernetes Node\u0026gt;\toudsm oudsm-1 oudsm-2 oudsm-N  In the table above, host names are based on the value \u0026lsquo;oudsm\u0026rsquo; as the deployment/release name for the Helm chart installation. When an External LoadBalancer is not available/configured, Interfaces can be accessed through NodePort on the Kubernetes Node.  Validate OUDSM URL\u0026rsquo;s   Launch a browser and access the OUDSM console.\n If using an External LoadBalancer: https://\u0026lt;External LBR Host\u0026gt;/oudsm. If not using an External LoadBalancer use https://\u0026lt;Kubernetes Node\u0026gt;:30443/oudsm.    Access the WebLogic Administration console by accessing the following URL and login with weblogic/\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; where weblogic/\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; is the adminUser and adminPass set when creating the OUDSM instance.\n If using an External LoadBalancer: https://\u0026lt;External LBR Host\u0026gt;/console.

Create a helper pod:\n kubectl run --image=container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July`24\u0026gt; --image-pull-policy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; --overrides='{\u0026quot;apiVersion\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;v1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;spec\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;imagePullSecrets\u0026quot;: [{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot;}]}}' helper -n oigns -- sleep infinity ``\nb. Clean down the failed domain creation by following steps 1-3 in Delete the OIG domain home.\nc. Execute the steps in Create OIG domain using WDT Models again.\n  Note You might need to recreate the domain creation image depending upon the errors. Domain creation logs are stored in \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/domains/wdt-logs.\n  If there is any issues while bringing up AdminServer, SOA Server or OIM Server, you can run the following to check the logs:\n$ kubectl logs \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oigns If the above does not give any information you can also run:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oigns For more details related to debugging issues, refer to Domain Debugging.\n  "

AdminServer   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is oam_cluster for the OAM domain. oam_cluster   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path wdt, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the OAM domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. accessdomain   domainType Type of the domain. Mandatory input for OAM domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type value: oam (deploys an OAM domain) oam   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. true   image OAM container image. The operator requires OAM 12.2.1.4. Refer to Obtain the OAM container image for details on how to obtain or create the image. oracle/oam:12.2.1.4.0   imagePullPolicy WebLogic container image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the container registry to pull the OAM container image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/accessdomain   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. oam_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. oamns   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. accessdomain-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are Never, IfNeeded, AdminOnly. IfNeeded   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. accessdomain-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the container registry, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example OAM1. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. OAM1   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. accessdomain-rcu-credentials   datasourceType Type of JDBC datasource applicable for the OAM domain. Legal values are agl and generic. Choose agl for Active GridLink datasource and generic for Generic datasource. For enterprise deployments, Oracle recommends that you use GridLink data sources to connect to Oracle RAC databases. See the Enterprise Deployment Guide for further details. generic    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an OAM domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script   Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o /\u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output The output will look similar to the following:\nInput parameters being used export version=\u0026quot;create-weblogic-sample-domain-inputs-v1\u0026quot; export adminPort=\u0026quot;7001\u0026quot; export adminServerName=\u0026quot;AdminServer\u0026quot; export domainUID=\u0026quot;accessdomain\u0026quot; export domainType=\u0026quot;oam\u0026quot; export domainHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain\u0026quot; export serverStartPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNeeded\u0026quot; export clusterName=\u0026quot;oam_cluster\u0026quot; export configuredManagedServerCount=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; export initialManagedServerReplicas=\u0026quot;2\u0026quot; export managedServerNameBase=\u0026quot;oam_server\u0026quot; export managedServerPort=\u0026quot;14100\u0026quot; export image=\u0026quot;container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oam_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July'24\u0026gt;\u0026quot; export imagePullPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; export imagePullSecretName=\u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot; export productionModeEnabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export weblogicCredentialsSecretName=\u0026quot;accessdomain-credentials\u0026quot; export includeServerOutInPodLog=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export logHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/accessdomain\u0026quot; export httpAccessLogInLogHome=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export t3ChannelPort=\u0026quot;30012\u0026quot; export exposeAdminT3Channel=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export adminNodePort=\u0026quot;30701\u0026quot; export exposeAdminNodePort=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export namespace=\u0026quot;oamns\u0026quot; javaOptions=-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false export persistentVolumeClaimName=\u0026quot;accessdomain-domain-pvc\u0026quot; export domainPVMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptsMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/weblogic\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptName=\u0026quot;create-domain-job.sh\u0026quot; export createDomainFilesDir=\u0026quot;wlst\u0026quot; export rcuSchemaPrefix=\u0026quot;OAMK8S\u0026quot; export rcuDatabaseURL=\u0026quot;mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com\u0026quot; export rcuCredentialsSecret=\u0026quot;accessdomain-rcu-credentials\u0026quot; export datasourceType=\u0026quot;generic\u0026quot; validateWlsDomainName called with accessdomain createFiles - valuesInputFile is create-domain-inputs.yaml createDomainScriptName is create-domain-job.sh Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/create-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/delete-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/domain.yaml Checking to see if the secret accessdomain-credentials exists in namespace oamns configmap/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm created Checking the configmap accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm was created configmap/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm labeled Checking if object type job with name accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job exists No resources found in oamns namespace.

The minimum recommended values are -Xms4096m -Xmx8192m. However, Oracle recommends you to set these to -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m in a production environment.\n  Navigate to the /output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain   Edit the domain.yaml file and inside name: accessdomain-oam-cluster, add the memory setting as below:\n serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; For example:\napiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: accessdomain-oam-cluster namespace: oamns spec: clusterName: oam_cluster serverService: precreateService: true serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; replicas: 1 Note: The above CPU and memory values are for examples only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\nNote: If required you can also set the same resources and limits for the accessdomain-policy-cluster.\n  In the domain.yaml locate the section of the file starting with adminServer:. Under the env: tag add the following CLASSPATH entries. This is required for running the idmconfigtool from the Administration Server.\n- name: CLASSPATH value: \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/wlserver/server/lib/weblogic.jar\u0026quot; For example:\n# adminServer is used to configure the desired behavior for starting the administration server. adminServer: # adminService: # channels: # The Admin Server's NodePort # - channelName: default # nodePort: 30701 # Uncomment to export the T3Channel as a service # - channelName: T3Channel serverPod: # an (optional) list of environment variable to be set on the admin servers env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms512m -Xmx1024m \u0026quot; - name: CLASSPATH value: \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/wlserver/server/lib/weblogic.jar\u0026quot;   If required, you can add the optional parameter maxClusterConcurrentStartup to the spec section of the domain.yaml. This parameter specifies the number of managed servers to be started in sequence per cluster. For example if you updated the initialManagedServerReplicas to 4 in create-domain-inputs.yaml and only had 2 nodes, then setting maxClusterConcurrentStartup: 1 will start one managed server at a time on each node, rather than starting them all at once. This can be useful to take the strain off individual nodes at startup. Below is an example with the parameter added:\napiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v9\u0026quot; kind: Domain metadata: name: accessdomain namespace: oamns labels: weblogic.domainUID: accessdomain spec: # The WebLogic Domain Home domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain maxClusterConcurrentStartup: 1 # The domain home source type # Set to PersistentVolume for domain-in-pv, Image for domain-in-image, or FromModel for model-in-image domainHomeSourceType: PersistentVolume ....   Save the changes to domain.yaml\n  Initializing the domain   Create the Kubernetes resource using the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;/domain.yaml For example:\n$ kubectl apply -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/domain.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain created cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster created cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-policy-cluster created   Verify the results Verify the domain, pods and services   Verify the domain, servers pods and services are created and in the READY state with a status of 1/1, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 11m pod/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 18m pod/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3m31s pod/accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3m31s pod/helper 1/1 Running 0 33m NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/accessdomain-adminserver ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 7001/TCP 11m service/accessdomain-cluster-oam-cluster ClusterIP 10.101.59.154 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-cluster-policy-cluster ClusterIP 10.98.236.51 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 ClusterIP 10.104.92.12 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 ClusterIP 10.96.244.37 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 ClusterIP 10.105.201.23 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr5 ClusterIP 10.110.12.227 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server2 ClusterIP 10.96.137.33 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server3 ClusterIP 10.103.178.35 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server4 ClusterIP 10.97.254.78 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s service/accessdomain-oam-server5 ClusterIP 10.105.65.104 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 3m31s NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job 1/1 2m6s 18m NAME AGE domain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain 12m NAME AGE cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster 11m cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-policy-cluster 11m Note: It will take several minutes before all the services listed above show. When a pod has a STATUS of 0/1 the pod is started but the OAM server associated with it is currently starting. While the pods are starting you can check the startup status in the pod logs, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl logs accessdomain-adminserver -n oamns $ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 -n oamns $ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-server1 -n oamns etc.. The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001. A configured OAM cluster named oam_cluster of size 5. A configured Policy Manager cluster named policy_cluster of size 5. One started OAM Managed Server, named oam_server1, listening on port 14100.

Run the create domain scripts\n  Verify the results\na. Verify the domain, pods and services\nb. Verify the domain\nc. Verify the pods\n  Introduction The OIG deployment scripts demonstrate the creation of an OIG domain home on an existing Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC). The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain.\nNote: If you want to create the OIG domain using WDT models, skip the steps below and go to Create OIG Domains Using WDT Models.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n Review the Domain resource documentation. Ensure that you have executed all the preliminary steps documented in Prepare your environment. Ensure that the database is up and running.  Prepare the create domain script The sample scripts for Oracle Identity Governance domain deployment are available at $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain.\n  Make a copy of the create-domain-inputs.yaml file:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ cp create-domain-inputs.yaml create-domain-inputs.yaml.orig   Edit the create-domain-inputs.yaml and modify the following parameters. Save the file when complete:\nNote: Do not edit any other parameters other than ones mentioned below.\ndomainUID: \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; image: \u0026lt;image_name\u0026gt; imagePullSecretName: \u0026lt;container_registry_secret\u0026gt; weblogicCredentialsSecretName: \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; logHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/\u0026lt;domain_id\u0026gt; namespace: \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; persistentVolumeClaimName: \u0026lt;pvc_name\u0026gt; rcuSchemaPrefix: \u0026lt;rcu_prefix\u0026gt; rcuDatabaseURL: \u0026lt;rcu_db_host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;rcu_db_port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;rcu_db_service_name\u0026gt; rcuCredentialsSecret: \u0026lt;kubernetes_rcu_secret\u0026gt; frontEndHost: \u0026lt;front_end_hostname\u0026gt; frontEndPort: \u0026lt;front_end_port\u0026gt; For example:\ndomainUID: governancedomain domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/governancedomain image: container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July'24\u0026gt; imagePullSecretName: orclcred weblogicCredentialsSecretName: oig-domain-credentials logHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/governancedomain namespace: oigns persistentVolumeClaimName: governancedomain-domain-pvc rcuSchemaPrefix: OIGK8S rcuDatabaseURL: mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com rcuCredentialsSecret: oig-rcu-credentials frontEndHost: example.com frontEndPort: 14100 Note: For now frontEndHost and front_end_port should be set to example.com and 14100 respectively. These values will be changed to the correct values in post installation tasks in Set OIMFrontendURL using MBeans.\n  A full list of parameters in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file are shown below:\n   Parameter Definition Default     adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is oimcluster for the OIG domain. oimcluster   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path wdt, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the OIG domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/oimcluster   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. oimcluster   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. true   image OIG container image. The operator requires OIG 12.2.1.4. Refer to OIG domains for details on how to obtain or create the image. oracle/oig:12.2.1.4.0   imagePullPolicy WebLogic container image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the container registry to pull the OIG container image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/oimcluster   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. oim_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. oimcluster   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. oimcluster-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are Never, IfNeeded, AdminOnly. IfNeeded   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. oimcluster-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the container registry, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example OIGK8S. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. OIGK8S   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. oimcluster-rcu-credentials   frontEndHost The entry point URL for the OIM. Not set   frontEndPort The entry point port for the OIM. Not set   datasourceType Type of JDBC datasource applicable for the OIG domain. Legal values are agl and generic. Choose agl for Active GridLink datasource and generic for Generic datasource. For enterprise deployments, Oracle recommends that you use GridLink data sources to connect to Oracle RAC databases. See the Enterprise Deployment Guide for further details. generic    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an OIG domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script Generate the create domain script   Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ mkdir output $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o /\u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ mkdir output $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output The output will look similar to the following:\nInput parameters being used export version=\u0026quot;create-weblogic-sample-domain-inputs-v1\u0026quot; export adminPort=\u0026quot;7001\u0026quot; export adminServerName=\u0026quot;AdminServer\u0026quot; export domainUID=\u0026quot;governancedomain\u0026quot; export domainHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/governancedomain\u0026quot; export serverStartPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNeeded\u0026quot; export clusterName=\u0026quot;oim_cluster\u0026quot; export configuredManagedServerCount=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; export initialManagedServerReplicas=\u0026quot;1\u0026quot; export managedServerNameBase=\u0026quot;oim_server\u0026quot; export managedServerPort=\u0026quot;14000\u0026quot; export image=\u0026quot;container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July'24\u0026gt;\u0026quot; export imagePullPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; export imagePullSecretName=\u0026quot;orclcred\u0026quot; export productionModeEnabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export weblogicCredentialsSecretName=\u0026quot;oig-domain-credentials\u0026quot; export includeServerOutInPodLog=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export logHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/governancedomain\u0026quot; export t3ChannelPort=\u0026quot;30012\u0026quot; export exposeAdminT3Channel=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export adminNodePort=\u0026quot;30701\u0026quot; export exposeAdminNodePort=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export namespace=\u0026quot;oigns\u0026quot; javaOptions=-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false export persistentVolumeClaimName=\u0026quot;governancedomain-domain-pvc\u0026quot; export domainPVMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptsMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/weblogic\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptName=\u0026quot;create-domain-job.sh\u0026quot; export createDomainFilesDir=\u0026quot;wlst\u0026quot; export rcuSchemaPrefix=\u0026quot;OIGK8S\u0026quot; export rcuDatabaseURL=\u0026quot;mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com\u0026quot; export rcuCredentialsSecret=\u0026quot;oig-rcu-credentials\u0026quot; export frontEndHost=\u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot; export frontEndPort=\u0026quot;14100\u0026quot; export datasourceType=\u0026quot;generic\u0026quot; validateWlsDomainName called with governancedomain createFiles - valuesInputFile is create-domain-inputs.yaml createDomainScriptName is create-domain-job.sh Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/create-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/delete-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/domain.yaml Checking to see if the secret governancedomain-domain-credentials exists in namespace oigns configmap/governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm created Checking the configmap governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm was created configmap/governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm labeled Checking if object type job with name governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job exists No resources found in oigns namespace.

Note: The above CPU and memory values are for examples only. For Enterprise Deployments, please review the performance recommendations and sizing requirements in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster.\nNote: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in CPU units. One CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers, and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors. An \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; suffix in a CPU attribute indicates ‘milli-CPU’, so 500m is 50% of a CPU. Memory can be expressed in various units, where one Mi is one IEC unit mega-byte (1024^2), and one Gi is one IEC unit giga-byte (1024^3). For more information, see Resource Management for Pods and Containers, Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods, and Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.\nNote: The parameters above are also utilized by the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). For more details on HPA, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.\nNote: If required you can also set the same resources and limits for the governancedomain-soa-cluster.\n  Run the create domain scripts   Create the Kubernetes resource using the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; $ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain $ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain unchanged cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster created cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-soa-cluster created   Run the following command to view the status of the OIG pods:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will initially look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-8cww8 0/1 Completed 0 27m governancedomain-introspect-domain-job-p4brt 1/1 Running 0 6s helper 1/1 Running 0 3h30m The introspect-domain-job pod will be displayed first.

If you wish to use autoscaling, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Please note, if you have enabled autoscaling, it is recommended to delete the autoscaler before running the commands below.\nView existing OAM servers The default OAM deployment starts the Administration Server (AdminServer), one OAM Managed Server (oam_server1) and one OAM Policy Manager server (oam_policy_mgr1).\nThe deployment also creates, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t start, four extra OAM Managed Servers (oam-server2 to oam-server5) and four more OAM Policy Manager servers (oam_policy_mgr2 to oam_policy_mgr5).\nAll these servers are visible in the WebLogic Server Console https://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:${MASTERNODE-PORT}/console by navigating to Domain Structure \u0026gt; oamcluster \u0026gt; Environment \u0026gt; Servers.\nTo view the running servers using kubectl, run the following command:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output should look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 3h29m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3h21m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3h21m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-76fb7678f-k8rhq 1/1 Running 0 55m Starting/Scaling up OAM Managed Servers The number of OAM Managed Servers running is dependent on the replicas parameter configured for the oam-cluster.

	"content": " View existing OIG servers Starting/Scaling up OIG Managed servers Stopping/Scaling down OIG Managed servers Stopping and starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers Domain lifecycle sample scripts  As OIG domains use the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, domain lifecyle operations are managed using the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator itself.\nThis document shows the basic operations for starting, stopping and scaling servers in the OIG domain.\nFor more detailed information refer to Domain Life Cycle in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nDo not use the WebLogic Server Administration Console or Oracle Enterprise Manager Console to start or stop servers.\n Note: The instructions below are for starting, stopping, or scaling servers manually. If you wish to use autoscaling, see Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Please note, if you have enabled autoscaling, it is recommended to delete the autoscaler before running the commands below.\nView existing OIG Servers The default OIG deployment starts the Administration Server (AdminServer), one OIG Managed Server (oim_server1) and one SOA Managed Server (soa_server1).\nThe deployment also creates, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t start, four extra OIG Managed Servers (oim-server2 to oim-server5) and four more SOA Managed Servers (soa_server2 to soa_server5).\nAll these servers are visible in the WebLogic Server Administration Console https://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:${MASTERNODE-PORT}/console by navigating to Domain Structure \u0026gt; governancedomain \u0026gt; Environment \u0026gt; Servers.\nTo view the running servers using kubectl, run the following command:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output should look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 23h governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 23h governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 23h Starting/Scaling up OIG Managed Servers The number of OIG Managed Servers running is dependent on the replicas parameter configured for the cluster. To start more OIG Managed Servers perform the following steps:\n  Run the following kubectl command to edit the oim_cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster \u0026lt;cluster_name\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl edit cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster -n oigns Note: This opens an edit session for the domain where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oim_cluster. By default the replicas parameter is set to \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; hence a single OIG Managed Server is started (oim_server1):\nspec: clusterName: oim_cluster replicas: 1 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m ...

	"content": " Introduction Install Elasticsearch and Kibana Create a Kubernetes secret Enable Logstash  Upgrade OUD deployment with ELK configuration Verify the pods Troubleshooting   Verify and access the Kibana console  Introduction This section describes how to install and configure logging and visualization for the oud-ds-rs Helm chart deployment.\nThe ELK stack consists of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Using ELK you can gain insights in real-time from the log data from your applications.\n Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected. Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. It gives you the freedom to select the way you give shape to your data. And you don’t always have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.  Install Elasticsearch and Kibana If you do not already have a centralized Elasticsearch (ELK) stack then you must configure this first. For details on how to configure the ELK stack, follow Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana\nCreate the logstash pod Variables used in this chapter In order to create the logstash pod, you must create a yaml file. This file contains variables which you must substitute with variables applicable to your ELK environment.\nMost of the values for the variables will be based on your ELK deployment as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nThe table below outlines the variables and values you must set:\n   Variable Sample Value Description     \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; 8.3.1 The version of logstash you want to install.   \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; true If SSL is enabled for ELK set the value to true, or if NON-SSL set to false. This value must be lowercase.   \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200 The URL for sending logs to Elasticsearch. HTTP if NON-SSL is used.   \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; logstash_internal The name of the user for logstash to access Elasticsearch.   \u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; password The password for ELK_USER.   \u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; apikey The API key details.    You will also need the BASE64 version of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) that signed the certificate of the Elasticsearch server. If using a self-signed certificate, this is the self signed certificate of the Elasticsearch server. See Copying the Elasticsearch Certificate for details on how to get the correct certificate. In the example below the certificate is called elk.crt.\nCreate a kubernetes secret   Create a Kubernetes secret for Elasticsearch using the API Key or Password.\na) If ELK uses an API Key for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created b) If ELK uses a password for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created Note: It is recommended that the ELK Stack is created with authentication enabled. If no authentication is enabled you may create a secret using the values above.\n  Check that the dockercred secret that was created previously in Create a Kubernetes secret for cronjob images exists:\n$ kubectl get secret -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; | grep dockercred For example,\n$ kubectl get secret -n oudns | grep dockercred The output will look similar to the following:\ndockercred kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson 1 149m If the secret does not exist, create it as per Create a Kubernetes secret for cronjob images.\n  Enable logstash   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory and create a logging-override-values.yaml file as follows:\nelk: imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred IntegrationEnabled: true logStashImage: logstash:\u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; logstashConfigMap: false esindex: oudlogs-00001 sslenabled: \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; eshosts: \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; # Note: We need to provide either esuser,espassword or esapikey esuser: \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; espassword: elasticsearch-pw-elastic esapikey: elasticsearch-pw-elastic  Change the \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; to match the values for your environment. If using SSL, replace the elk.crt in $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm/oud-ds-rs/certs/ with the elk.crt for your ElasticSearch server. If using API KEY for your ELK authentication, leave both esuser: and espassword: with no value. If using a password for ELK authentication, leave esapi_key: but delete elasticsearch-pw-elastic. If no authentication is used for ELK, leave esuser, espassword, and esapi_key with no value assigned. The rest of the lines in the yaml file should not be changed.

	"description": "Describes the steps for logging and visualization with Elasticsearch and Kibana.",
	"content": "Introduction This section describes how to install and configure logging and visualization for the oudsm Helm chart deployment.\nThe ELK stack consists of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Using ELK you can gain insights in real-time from the log data from your applications.\n Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected. Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. It gives you the freedom to select the way you give shape to your data. And you don’t always have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.  Install Elasticsearch and Kibana If you do not already have a centralized Elasticsearch (ELK) stack then you must configure this first. For details on how to configure the ELK stack, follow Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana\nCreate the logstash pod Variables used in this chapter In order to create the logstash pod, you must create a yaml file. This file contains variables which you must substitute with variables applicable to your ELK environment.\nMost of the values for the variables will be based on your ELK deployment as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nThe table below outlines the variables and values you must set:\n   Variable Sample Value Description     \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; 8.3.1 The version of logstash you want to install.   \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; true If SSL is enabled for ELK set the value to true, or if NON-SSL set to false. This value must be lowercase.   \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200 The URL for sending logs to Elasticsearch. HTTP if NON-SSL is used.   \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; logstash_internal The name of the user for logstash to access Elasticsearch.   \u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; password The password for ELK_USER.   \u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; apikey The API key details.    You will also need the BASE64 version of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) that signed the certificate of the Elasticsearch server. If using a self-signed certificate, this is the self signed certificate of the Elasticsearch server. See Copying the Elasticsearch Certificate for details on how to get the correct certificate. In the example below the certificate is called elk.crt.\nCreate Kubernetes secrets   Create a Kubernetes secret for Elasticsearch using the API Key or Password.\na) If ELK uses an API Key for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudsmns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created b) If ELK uses a password for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oudsmns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created Note: It is recommended that the ELK Stack is created with authentication enabled. If no authentication is enabled you may create a secret using the values above.\n  Create a Kubernetes secret to access the required images on hub.docker.com:\nNote: You must first have a user account on hub.docker.com:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;dockercred\u0026#34; --docker-server=\u0026#34;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026#34; --docker-username=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;docker_username\u0026gt;\u0026#34; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=\u0026lt;docker_email_credentials\u0026gt; --namespace=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026quot;dockercred\u0026quot; --docker-server=\u0026quot;https://index.docker.io/v1/\u0026quot; --docker-username=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot; --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; --docker-email=user@example.com --namespace=oudsmns The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/dockercred created   Enable logstash   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm directory and create a logging-override-values.yaml file as follows:\nelk: imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred IntegrationEnabled: true logStashImage: logstash:\u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; logstashConfigMap: false esindex: oudsmlogs-00001 sslenabled: \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; eshosts: \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; # Note: We need to provide either esuser,espassword or esapikey esuser: \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; espassword: elasticsearch-pw-elastic esapikey: elasticsearch-pw-elastic  Change the \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt;, to match the values for your environment. If using SSL, replace the elk.crt in $WORKDIR/kubernetes/helm/oudsm/certs/ with the elk.crt for your ElasticSearch server. If using API KEY for your ELK authentication, leave both esuser: and espassword: with no value. If using a password for ELK authentication, leave esapi_key: but delete elasticsearch-pw-elastic.

Verify the domain\nc. Verify the pods\n  Introduction This section demonstrates the creation of an OAM domain home using sample WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model files.\nFrom WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.1.2 onwards, you can provide a section, domain.spec.configuration.initializeDomainOnPV, to initialize an OAM domain on a persistent volume when it is first deployed. This eliminates the need to pre-create your OAM domain using sample Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST) offline scripts.\nWith WLST offline scripts it is required to deploy a separate Kubernetes job that creates the domain on a persistent volume, and then deploy the domain with a custom resource YAML. The RCU schema also had to be created manually. Now, using WDT models, all the required information is specified in the domain custom resource YAML file, eliminating the requirement for a separate Kubernetes job. With WDT models, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator will create the RCU schemas, create the persistent volume and claim, then create the WebLogic domain on the persistent volume, prior to starting the servers.\nNote: This is a one time only initialization. After the domain is created, subsequent updates to this section in the domain resource YAML file will not recreate or update the WebLogic domain. Subsequent domain lifecycle updates must be controlled by the WebLogic Server Administration Console, Enterprise Manager Console, WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST), or other mechanisms.\nWeblogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) models are a convenient and simple alternative to WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) configuration scripts. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using model files, variable properties files, and application archive files. For more information about the model format and its integration, see Usage and Working with WDT Model files. The WDT model format is fully described in the open source, WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub project.\nThe main benefits of WDT are:\n A set of single-purpose tools supporting Weblogic domain configuration lifecycle operations. All tools work off of a shared, declarative model, eliminating the need to maintain specialized WLST scripts. WDT knowledge base understands the MBeans, attributes, and WLST capabilities/bugs across WLS versions.  The initializeDomainOnPv section:\n Creates the PersistentVolume (PV) and/or PersistenVolumeClaim (PVC). Creates the RCU schema. Creates the OAM domain home on the persistent volume based on the provided WDT models  Prerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n Review the Domain On PV documentation. Ensure that the database is up and running.  Create OAM domains using WDT models In this section you will:\n Prepare the persistent storage. Create Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU. Generate the WDT models and the domain resource yaml file. Build the domain creation image hosting the WDT models and WDT installation. Deploy the OAM domain resource  Note: In this section a domain creation image is built using the supplied model files and that image is used for domain creation. You will need your own container registry to upload the domain image to. Having your own container repository is a prerequisite before creating an OAM domain with WDT models. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have your own container registry, you can load the image on each node in the cluster instead. This documentation does not explain how to create your own container registry, or how to load the image onto each node. Consult your vendor specific documentation for more information.\nNote: Building a domain creation image is a one time activity. The domain creation image can be used to create an OAM domain in multiple environments. You do not need to rebuild the domain creation image every time you create a domain.\nPrepare the persistent storage As referenced in Prerequisites the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must have access to a persistent volume such as a Network File System (NFS) mount or a shared file system.\nDomain on persistent volume (Domain on PV) is an operator domain home source type, which requires that the domain home exists on a persistent volume.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Oracle Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\nTo create the persistent volume run the following commands:\n  Create the required directories:\n$ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv For example:\n$ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv touch file.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt   On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/accessdomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt   Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it’s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\nFor more information on PV and PVC requirements, see Domain on Persistent Volume (PV).\n  Create Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU In this section you create the Kubernetes secrets for the OAM doman and RCU.\n  Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain using the create-weblogic-credentials script in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;username=weblogic\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;domain-uid\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials where:\n-n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; is the domain namespace you created in Create a namespace for Oracle Access Management.

For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026quot;privatecred\u0026quot; --docker-server=container-registry.example.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026quot;user@example.com\u0026quot; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oamns Then specify both secrets for imagePullSecrets in the domain.yaml.

If the RCU Schema with the given prefix already exists, and error will be thrown and the domain creation will fail. If you want to delete the schema every time during domain deployment, then can use change the value \u0026quot;-Dwdt.config.disable.rcu.drop.schema=true\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;-Dwdt.config.disable.rcu.drop.schema=false\u0026quot;.\n  Optional WDT Models ConfigMap If required, you can provide a Kubernetes ConfigMap with additional WDT models and WDT variables files as supplements, or overrides, to those in domainCreationImages. For example in the output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/domain.yaml:\n domain: ... domainCreationImages: ... domainCreationConfigMap: mymodel-domain-configmap The files inside domainCreationConfigMap must have file extensions, .yaml, .properties, or .zip.\n  To create a configmap run the following command:\n $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-configmap.sh -n oamns -d accessdomain -c mymodel-domain-configmap -f wdt_models/mymodel.yaml   For more information on the usage of additional configuration, see Optional WDT models ConfigMap.\nDeploy the OAM domain In this section you deploy the OAM domain using the domain.yaml.\n  Run the following command to create OAM domain resources:\n$ kubectl create -f $WORKDIR/yaml/domain.yaml The following steps will be performed by WebLogic Kubernetes Operator:\n Run the introspector job. The introspection job will create the RCU Schemas. The introspector job pod will create the domain on PV using the model provided in the domain creation image. The introspector job pod will execute OAM offline configuration actions post successful creation of domain via WDT. Brings up the Administration Server, OAM server (oam_server1), and the OAM Policy Managed Server (oam_policy_mgr1).  The output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain created cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster created cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-policy-cluster created Whilst the domain creation is running, you can run the following command to monitor the progress:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns -w You can also tail the logs for the pods by running:\n$ kubectl logs -f \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oamns WDT specific logs can be found in \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/domains/wdt-logs.\nOnce everything is started you should see the Administration Server and OAM servers are running:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 11m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3m53s accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3m53s   If there are any failures, follow Domain creation failure with WDT models in the Troubleshooting section.\nVerify the results Verify the domain, pods and services   Verify the domain, servers pods and services are created and in the READY state with a STATUS of 1/1, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 12m pod/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 4m19s pod/accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 4m19s NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/accessdomain-adminserver ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 7001/TCP 12m service/accessdomain-cluster-oam-cluster ClusterIP 10.104.17.83 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-cluster-policy-cluster ClusterIP 10.98.157.157 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 ClusterIP 10.101.141.238 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 ClusterIP 10.107.167.143 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 ClusterIP 10.106.100.191 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr5 ClusterIP 10.105.5.126 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 15100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-server2 ClusterIP 10.98.248.74 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-server3 ClusterIP 10.106.224.54 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-server4 ClusterIP 10.104.241.109 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 4m19s service/accessdomain-oam-server5 ClusterIP 10.96.189.205 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14100/TCP 4m19s NAME AGE domain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain 18m NAME AGE cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster 18m cluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-policy-cluster 18m The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001.

Verify the domain\nc. Verify the pods\n  Introduction This section demonstrates the creation of an OIG domain home using sample WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model files.\nFrom WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.1.2 onwards, you can provide a section, domain.spec.configuration.initializeDomainOnPV, to automatically initialize an OIG domain on a persistent volume when it is first deployed. This eliminates the need to pre-create your OIG domain using sample WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) offline scripts.\nWith WLST offline scripts it is required to deploy a separate Kubernetes job that creates the domain on a persistent volume, and then deploy the domain with a custom resource YAML. The RCU schema also had to be created and patched manually beforehand. Now, starting from Apr'24 release onwards, using WDT models, all the required information is specified in the domain custom resource YAML file, eliminating the requirement for running a separate Kubernetes job. With WDT models, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator will create the PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistenVolumeClaim (PVC), create the RCU schemas and patch them, then create the OIG domain on the persistent volume, prior to starting the servers.\nNote: This is a one time only initialization. After the domain is created, subsequent updates to this section in the domain resource YAML file will not recreate or update the WebLogic domain. Subsequent domain lifecycle updates must be controlled by the WebLogic Server Administration Console, Enterprise Manager Console, WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST), or other mechanisms.\nWebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) models are a convenient and simple alternative to WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) configuration scripts. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using model files, variable properties files, and application archive files. For more information about the model format and its integration, see Usage and Working with WDT Model files. The WDT model format is fully described in the open source, WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub project.\nThe main benefits of WDT are:\n A set of single-purpose tools supporting WebLogic domain configuration lifecycle operations. All tools work off of a shared, declarative model, eliminating the need to maintain specialized WLST scripts. WDT knowledge base understands the MBeans, attributes, and WLST capabilities/bugs across WLS versions.  The initializeDomainOnPv section:\n Creates the PersistentVolume (PV) and/or PersistenVolumeClaim (PVC). Creates and patches the RCU schema. Creates the OIG domain home on the persistent volume based on the provided WDT models  Prerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n Review the Domain On PV documentation. Ensure that the database is up and running.  Create OIG domains using WDT models In this section you will:\n Prepare the persistent storage. Create Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU. Generate WDT models and the domain resource yaml file. Build the domain creation image hosting the WDT models and WDT installation. Deploy the OIG domain resource.  Note: In this section a domain creation image is built using the supplied model files and that image is used for domain creation. You will need your own container registry to upload the domain image to. Having your own container repository is a prerequisite before creating an OIG domain with WDT models. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have your own container registry, you can load the image on each node in the cluster instead. This documentation does not explain how to create your own container registry, or how to load the image onto each node. Consult your vendor specific documentation for more information.\nNote: Building a domain creation image is a one time activity. The domain creation image can be used to create an OIG domain in multiple environments. You do not need to rebuild the domain creation image every time you create a domain.\nPrepare the persistent storage As referenced in Prerequisites the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must have access to a persistent volume such as a Network File System (NFS) mount or a shared file system.\nDomain on persistent volume (Domain on PV) is an operator domain home source type, which requires that the domain home exists on a persistent volume.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Oracle Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (\u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nNote: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s). In this example /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\nTo create the persistent volume run the following commands:\n  Create the required directories:\n$ mkdir -p \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv For example,\n$ mkdir -p /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv   On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/governancedomainpv touch file.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt   On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/shared/governancedomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt   Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it’s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\nFor more information on PV and PVC requirements, see Domain on Persistent Volume (PV).\n  Create Kubernetes secrets for the domain and RCU   Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain using the create-secret.sh script in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;username=weblogic\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;password=****\u0026#34; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials where:\n-n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; is the domain namespace you created in Create a namespace for Oracle Identity Governance. For example oigns.\n-d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; is the domain UID that you want to create. For example, governancedomain.\n-s \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials is the name of the secret for this namespace. Note: The secret name must follow this format (\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials) or domain creation will fail.\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;username=weblogic\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -n oigns -d governancedomain -s governancedomain-weblogic-credentials The output will look similar to the following:\n@@ Info: Setting up secret \u0026#39;governancedomain-weblogic-credentials\u0026#39;. secret/governancedomain-weblogic-credentials created secret/governancedomain-weblogic-credentials labeled   Verify the secret is created using the following command:\n$ kubectl get secret \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; -o yaml -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get secret governancedomain-weblogic-credentials -o yaml -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\napiVersion: v1 data: password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; username: d2VibG9naWM= kind: Secret metadata: creationTimestamp: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt;\u0026quot; labels: weblogic.domainName: governancedomain weblogic.domainUID: governancedomain name: governancedomain-weblogic-credentials namespace: oigns resourceVersion: \u0026quot;3216738\u0026quot; uid: c2ec07e0-0135-458d-bceb-c648d2a9ac54 type: Opaque   Create a Kubernetes secret for RCU in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain, using the create-secrets.sh script:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-secret.sh -l \u0026#34;rcu_prefix=\u0026lt;rcu_prefix\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;rcu_schema_password=\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;db_host=\u0026lt;db_host.domain\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;db_port=\u0026lt;db_port\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;db_service=\u0026lt;service_name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;dba_user=\u0026lt;sys_db_user\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;dba_password=\u0026lt;sys_db_pwd\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-rcu-credentials where\n\u0026lt;rcu_prefix\u0026gt; is the name of the RCU schema to be created.\n\u0026lt;rcu_schema_pwd\u0026gt; is the password you want to create for the RCU schema prefix.\n\u0026lt;db_host.domain\u0026gt; is the database server hostname.\n\u0026lt;db_port\u0026gt; is the database listener port.\n\u0026lt;service_name\u0026gt; is the database service name.\n\u0026lt;sys_db_user\u0026gt; is the database user with sys dba privilege.\n\u0026lt;sys_db_pwd\u0026gt; is the sys database password.\n\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; is the domain_uid that you want to create.

You distribute WDT model files and the WDT executable using these images, and the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator uses them to manage the domain.\nNote: These images are only used for creating the domain and will not be used to update the domain. The domain creation image is used for domain creation only, it is not the product container image used for OIG.\nFor more details on creating the domain image, see Domain creation images.\nThe steps to build the domain creation image are shown in the sections below.\nPrerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n You have created the yaml files are per Generate WDT models and the domain resource yaml file. You have a container registry available to push the domain creation image to. A container image client on the build machine, such as Docker or Podman.  For Docker, a minimum version of 18.03.1.ce is required. For Podman, a minimum version of 3.0.1 is required.   An installed version of JDK to run Image Tool, version 8+. Proxies are set accordingly at the OS level if required.

For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026quot;privatecred\u0026quot; --docker-server=container-registry.example.com \\ --docker-username=\u0026quot;user@example.com\u0026quot; \\ --docker-password=password --docker-email=user@example.com \\ --namespace=oigns Then specify both secrets for imagePullSecrets in the domain.yaml. For example:\n ... spec: # The WebLogic Domain Home domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/governancedomain # The domain home source type # Set to PersistentVolume for domain-in-pv, Image for domain-in-image, or FromModel for model-in-image domainHomeSourceType: PersistentVolume # The WebLogic Server image that the Operator uses to start the domain image: \u0026quot;container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-\u0026lt;July'24\u0026gt;\u0026quot; # imagePullPolicy defaults to \u0026quot;Always\u0026quot; if image version is :latest imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets: - name: orclcred - name: privatecred # Identify which Secret contains the WebLogic Admin credentials ... ``\nFor more information about the configuration parameters in domain.yaml, see Domain Resources.\n  Click here to see an example domain.yaml:    # Copyright (c) 2024, Oracle and/or its affiliates. # Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl. # # This is an example of how to define an OIG Domain.

If the RCU Schema with the given prefix already exists, and error will be thrown and the domain creation will fail. If you want to delete the schema every time during domain deployment, then can change the value \u0026quot;-Dwdt.config.disable.rcu.drop.schema=true\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;-Dwdt.config.disable.rcu.drop.schema=false\u0026quot;.\n  Optional WDT Models ConfigMap If required, you can provide a Kubernetes ConfigMap with additional WDT models and WDT variables files as supplements, or overrides, to those in domainCreationImages. For example in the output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/domain.yaml:\n domain: ... domainCreationImages: ... domainCreationConfigMap: mymodel-domain-configmap The files inside domainCreationConfigMap must have file extensions, .yaml, .properties, or .zip.\n  To create a configmap run the following command:\n $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv/wdt-utils $ ./create-configmap.sh -n oigns -d governancedomain -c mymodel-domain-configmap -f wdt_models/mymodel.yaml   For more information on the usage of additional configuration, see Optional WDT models ConfigMap.\nDeploy the OIG domain In this section you deploy the OIG domain using the domain.yaml.\n  Run the following command to create OIG domain resources:\n$ kubectl create -f $WORKDIR/yaml/domain.yaml The following steps will be performed by WebLogic Kubernetes Operator:\n Run the introspector job. The introspection job will create the RCU Schemas and then patch them. The introspector job pod will create the domain on PV using the model provided in the domain creation image. The introspector job pod will execute OIG offline configuration actions post successful creation of domain via WDT. Brings up the Administration Server, and the SOA Managed Server (soa_server1).  The output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain created cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster created cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-soa-cluster created Whilst the domain creation is running, you can run the following command to monitor the progress:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns -w You can also tail the logs for the pods by running:\n$ kubectl logs -f \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oigns WDT specific logs can be found in \u0026lt;persistent_volume\u0026gt;/domains/wdt-logs.\nOnce everything is started you should see the Administration Server and SOA server are running:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 10m If there are any failures, follow Domain creation failure with WDT models in the Troubleshooting section.\nNote: Depending on the speed of your cluster, it can take around 25 minutes for all the pods to be in READY 1/1 state.\n  Start the OIM server by running the following command:\n $ kubectl patch cluster -n oigns governancedomain-oim-cluster --type=merge -p '{\u0026quot;spec\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;replicas\u0026quot;:1}}' ``\nThe output will look similar to the following:\n cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster patched ``\nYou can view the status of the OIM server by running:\n $ kubectl get pods -n oigns -w ``\nOnce the OIM server is running, the output will look similar to the following:\n NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 16m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 5m22s ``\n  Verify the results Verify the domain, pods and services   Verify the domain, servers pods and services are created and in the READY state with a STATUS of 1/1, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get all,domains -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\n NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 25m pod/governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 7m18s pod/governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 20m NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/governancedomain-adminserver ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 7001/TCP 25m service/governancedomain-cluster-oim-cluster ClusterIP 10.102.36.107 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14002/TCP,14000/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-cluster-soa-cluster ClusterIP 10.102.230.187 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-oim-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14002/TCP,14000/TCP 7m18s service/governancedomain-oim-server2 ClusterIP 10.111.183.16 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14002/TCP,14000/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-oim-server3 ClusterIP 10.107.144.169 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14002/TCP,14000/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-oim-server4 ClusterIP 10.110.18.114 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14002/TCP,14000/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-oim-server5 ClusterIP 10.106.220.13 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 14002/TCP,14000/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-soa-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-soa-server2 ClusterIP 10.104.204.68 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-soa-server3 ClusterIP 10.110.104.108 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-soa-server4 ClusterIP 10.103.117.118 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 20m service/governancedomain-soa-server5 ClusterIP 10.101.65.38 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 20m NAME AGE domain.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain 32m NAME AGE cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster 32m cluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-soa-cluster 32m The default domain created by the sample WDT models has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001.

If yes, then it deletes the helper pod. Brings up a new helper pod with the new image. Stops the Administration Server, SOA and OIM managed servers using serverStartPolicy set as Never in the domain definition yaml. Waits for all servers to be stopped (default timeout 2000s) Introspects database properties including credentials from the job configmap or RCU Secrets. Performs database schema changes from the helper pod Starts the Administration Server, SOA and OIM managed servers by setting serverStartPolicy to IfNeeded and image to new image tag. Waits for all the servers to be ready (default timeout 2000s)  The script exits with a failure if a configurable timeout is reached before the target pod count is reached, depending upon the domain configuration. It also exits if there is any failure while patching the database schema and domain.\nNote: The script execution will cause downtime while patching the OIG deployment and database schemas.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, perform the following steps:\n  Review the Domain resource documentation.\n  Ensure that you have a running OIG deployment in your cluster.\n  Ensure that the database is up and running.\n  Download the latest code repository Download the latest code repository as follows:\n  Create a working directory to setup the source code.\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/OIGK8Slatest   Download the latest OIG deployment scripts from the OIG repository.\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/24.3.1 For example:\n$ cd /scratch/OIGK8Slatest $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/24.3.1   Set the $WORKDIR environment variable as follows:\n$ export WORKDIR=\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance For example:\n$ export WORKDIR=/scratch/OIGK8Slatest/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance   Run the patch domain script   Run the patch domain script as follows.

This instructs the Managed Service to setup a Load Balancer to direct traffic to the NGINX ingress.\n  To install NGINX use the following helm command depending on if you are using NodePort or LoadBalancer:\na) Using NodePort\n$ helm install nginx-ingress -n nginxssl --set controller.extraArgs.default-ssl-certificate=oigns/governancedomain-tls-cert --set controller.service.type=NodePort --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false stable/ingress-nginx --version 4.7.2 The output will look similar to the following:\n$ helm install nginx-ingress -n nginxssl --set controller.extraArgs.default-ssl-certificate=oigns/governancedomain-tls-cert --set controller.service.type=NodePort --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false stable/ingress-nginx --version 4.7.2 NAME: nginx-ingress LAST DEPLOYED: \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; NAMESPACE: nginxssl STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The nginx-ingress controller has been installed.

If you want to enable access logs then set this value to true before executing the command. Enabling access-logs can cause issues with disk space if not regularly maintained.\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR $ helm install governancedomain-nginx kubernetes/charts/ingress-per-domain --namespace oigns --values kubernetes/charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME: governancedomain-nginx LAST DEPLOYED: \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt;

	"content": "After the OAM domain is set up you can publish operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.\nInstall Elasticsearch stack and Kibana If you do not already have a centralized Elasticsearch (ELK) stack then you must configure this first. For details on how to configure the ELK stack, follow Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana\nCreate the logstash pod Variables used in this chapter In order to create the logstash pod, you must create several files. These files contain variables which you must substitute with variables applicable to your environment.\nMost of the values for the variables will be based on your ELK deployment as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nThe table below outlines the variables and values you must set:\n   Variable Sample Value Description     \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; 8.3.1 The version of logstash you want to install.   \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; true If SSL is enabled for ELK set the value to true, or if NON-SSL set to false. This value must be lowercase.   \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200 The URL for sending logs to Elasticsearch. HTTP if NON-SSL is used.   \u0026lt;ELKNS\u0026gt; oamns The domain namespace.   \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; logstash_internal The name of the user for logstash to access Elasticsearch.   \u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; password The password for ELK_USER.   \u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; apikey The API key details.    You will also need the BASE64 version of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) that signed the certificate of the Elasticsearch server. If using a self-signed certificate, this is the self signed certificate of the Elasticsearch server. See Copying the Elasticsearch Certificate for details on how to get the correct certificate. In the example below the certificate is called elk.crt.\nCreate Kubernetes secrets   Create a Kubernetes secret for Elasticsearch using the API Key or Password.\na) If ELK uses an API Key for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oamns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created b) If ELK uses a password for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oamns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created Note: It is recommended that the ELK Stack is created with authentication enabled. If no authentication is enabled you may create a secret using the values above.\n  Create a Kubernetes secret to access the required images on hub.docker.com:\nNote: Before executing the command below, you must first have a user account on hub.docker.com.\nkubectl create secret docker-registry \u0026#34;dockercred\u0026#34;

This is usually because of an incorrect value set, or the certificate was not pasted with the correct indentation.\nIf the pod has errors, delete the pod and configmap as follows:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash.yaml $ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash_cm.yaml Once you have resolved the issue in the yaml files, run the commands outlined earlier to recreate the configmap and logstash pod.\n  Verify and access the Kibana console To access the Kibana console you will need the Kibana URL as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nFor Kibana 7.7.x and below:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Kibana \u0026gt; Index Patterns.\n  In the Create Index Pattern page enter oamlogs* for the Index pattern and click Next Step.\n  In the Configure settings page, from the Time Filter field name drop down menu select @timestamp and click Create index pattern.\n  Once the index pattern is created click on Discover in the navigation menu to view the OAM logs.\n  For Kibana version 7.8.X and above:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Stack Management.\n  Click Data Views in the Kibana section.\n  Click Create Data View and enter the following information:\n Name: oamlogs* Timestamp: @timestamp    Click Create Data View.\n  From the Navigation menu, click Discover to view the log file entries.\n  From the drop down menu, select oamlogs* to view the log file entries.\n  "

	"content": " Prerequisite configuration Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server  Troubleshooting   Deploy HPA Testing HPA Delete the HPA Other considerations  Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) allows automatic scaling (up and down) of the OUD servers. If load increases then extra OUD servers will be started as required. Similarly, if load decreases, OUD servers will be automatically shutdown.\nFor more information on HPA, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\nThe instructions below show you how to configure and run an HPA to scale OUD servers, based on CPU utilization or memory resource metrics.\nNote: If you enable HPA and then decide you want to start/stop/scale OUD servers manually as per Scaling Up/Down OUD Pods, it is recommended to delete HPA beforehand as per Delete the HPA.\nPrerequisite configuration In order to use HPA, OUD must have been created with the required resources parameter as per Create OUD instances. For example:\noudConfig: # memory, cpu parameters for both requests and limits for oud instances resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;500m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; If you created the OUD servers at any point since July 22 (22.3.1) then these values are the defaults. You can check using the following command:\n$ helm show values oud-ds-rs -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\n... # memory, cpu parameters for both requests and limits for oud instances resources: requests: memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; cpu: \u0026quot;500m\u0026quot; limits: memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; ... Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server Before deploying HPA you must deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n  Check to see if the Kubernetes Metrics Server is already deployed:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric If a row is returned as follows, then Kubernetes Metric Server is deployed and you can move to Deploy HPA.\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 5m13s   If no rows are returned by the previous command, then the Kubernetes Metric Server needs to be deployed. Run the following commands to get the components.yaml:\n$ mkdir $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml   Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/metrics-server created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created service/metrics-server created deployment.apps/metrics-server created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created   Run the following command to check Kubernetes Metric Server is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric Make sure the pod has a READY status of 1/1:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 39s   Troubleshooting If the Kubernetes Metric Server does not reach the READY 1/1 state, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system $ kubectl logs \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system If you see errors such as:\nReadiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500 and:\nE0907 13:07:50.937308 1 scraper.go:140] \u0026quot;Failed to scrape node\u0026quot; err=\u0026quot;Get \\\u0026quot;https://X.X.X.X:10250/metrics/resource\\\u0026quot;: x509: cannot validate certificate for 100.105.18.113 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs\u0026quot; node=\u0026quot;worker-node1\u0026quot; then you may need to install a valid cluster certificate for your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor testing purposes, you can resolve this issue by:\n  Delete the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml   Edit the $WORKDIR/hpa/components.yaml and locate the args: section. Add kubelet-insecure-tls to the arguments. For example:\nspec: containers: - args: - --cert-dir=/tmp - --secure-port=4443 - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname - --kubelet-use-node-status-port - --kubelet-insecure-tls - --metric-resolution=15s image: registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.6.4 ...   Deploy the Kubenetes Metrics Server using the command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml Run the following and make sure the READY status shows 1/1:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric The output should look similar to the following:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 40s   Deploy HPA The steps below show how to configure and run an HPA to scale OUD, based on the CPU or memory utilization resource metrics.\nAssuming the example OUD configuration in Create OUD instances, three OUD servers are started by default (oud-ds-rs-0, oud-ds-rs-1, oud-ds-rs-2).\nIn the following example an HPA resource is created, targeted at the statefulset oud-ds-rs. This resource will autoscale OUD servers from a minimum of 3 OUD servers up to 5 OUD servers. Scaling up will occur when the average CPU is consistently over 70%. Scaling down will occur when the average CPU is consistently below 70%.\n  Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa and create an autoscalehpa.yaml file that contains the following.\n# apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: oud-sts-hpa namespace: oudns spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: StatefulSet name: oud-ds-rs #statefulset name of oud behavior: scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 scaleUp: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 minReplicas: 3 maxReplicas: 5 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70 Note : minReplicas should match the number of OUD servers started by default. Set maxReplicas to the maximum amount of OUD servers that can be started.\nNote: To find the statefulset name, in this example oud-ds-rs, run \u0026ldquo;kubectl get statefulset -n oudns\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: For setting HPA based on Memory Metrics, update the metrics block with the following content. Please note we recommend using only CPU or Memory, not both.\nmetrics: - type: Resource resource: name: memory target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70   Run the following command to create the autoscaler:\n$ kubectl apply -f autoscalehpa.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/oud-sts-hpa created   Verify the status of the autoscaler by running the following:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE oud-sts-hpa StatefulSet/oud-ds-rs 5%/70% 3 5 3 33s In the example above, this shows that CPU is currently running at 5% for the oud-sts-hpa.\n  Testing HPA   Check the current status of the OUD servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h15m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h9m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h2m oud-pod-cron-job-28242120-bwtcz 0/1 Completed 0 61m oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 31m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 92s In the above oud-ds-rs-0, oud-ds-rs-0, oud-ds-rs-2 are running.\n  To test HPA can scale up the OUD servers, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty oud-ds-rs-0 -n oudns -- /bin/bash This will take you inside a bash shell inside the oud-ds-rs-0 pod:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ Inside the bash shell, run the following command to increase the load on the CPU:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null This command will continue to run in the foreground.\n  Repeat the step above for the oud-ds-rs-1 pod:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty oud-ds-rs-1 -n oudns -- /bin/bash [oracle@oud-ds-rs-1 oracle]$ [oracle@oud-ds-rs-1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null   In a command window outside the bash shells, run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE oud-sts-hpa StatefulSet/oud-ds-rs 125%/70% 3 5 3 5m15s In the above example the CPU has increased to 125%. As this is above the 70% limit, the autoscaler increases the replicas by starting additional OUD servers.\n  Run the following to see if any more OUD servers are started:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h50m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h44m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h37m oud-ds-rs-3 1/1 Running 0 9m29s oud-ds-rs-4 1/1 Running 0 5m17s oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 66m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 36m oud-pod-cron-job-28242210-kn7sv 0/1 Completed 0 6m28s In the example above one more OUD server has started (oud-ds-rs-4).\nNote: It may take some time for the server to appear and start. Once the server is at READY status of 1/1, the server is started.\n  To stop the load on the CPU, in both bash shells, issue a Control C, and then exit the bash shell:\n[oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null ^C [oracle@oud-ds-rs-0 oracle]$ exit   Run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE oud-sts-hpa StatefulSet/oud-ds-rs 4%/70% 3 5 5 40m In the above example CPU has dropped to 4%. As this is below the 70% threshold, you should see the autoscaler scale down the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h54m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h48m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h41m oud-ds-rs-3 1/1 Running 0 13m oud-ds-rs-4 1/1 Terminating 0 8m27s oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 70m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 40m oud-pod-cron-job-28242210-kn7sv 0/1 Completed 0 10m Eventually, the extra server will disappear:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 5h57m oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 5h51m oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 5h44m oud-ds-rs-3 1/1 Running 0 16m oud-pod-cron-job-28242150-qf8fg 0/1 Completed 0 73m oud-pod-cron-job-28242180-q69lm 0/1 Completed 0 43m oud-pod-cron-job-28242210-kn7sv 0/1 Completed 0 13m   Delete the HPA   If you need to delete the HPA, you can do so by running the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ kubectl delete -f autoscalehpa.yaml   Other considerations  If HPA is deployed and you need to upgrade the OUD image, then you must delete the HPA before upgrading. Once the upgrade is successful you can deploy HPA again. If you choose to scale up or scale down an OUD server manually as per Scaling Up/Down OUD Pods, then it is recommended to delete the HPA before doing so.  "

For details on how to configure the ELK stack, follow Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana\nCreate the logstash pod Variables used in this chapter In order to create the logstash pod, you must create several files. These files contain variables which you must substitute with variables applicable to your environment.\nMost of the values for the variables will be based on your ELK deployment as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nThe table below outlines the variables and values you must set:\n   Variable Sample Value Description     \u0026lt;ELK_VER\u0026gt; 8.3.1 The version of logstash you want to install.   \u0026lt;ELK_SSL\u0026gt; true If SSL is enabled for ELK set the value to true, or if NON-SSL set to false. This value must be lowercase.   \u0026lt;ELK_HOSTS\u0026gt; https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200 The URL for sending logs to Elasticsearch. HTTP if NON-SSL is used.   \u0026lt;ELKNS\u0026gt; oigns The domain namespace.   \u0026lt;ELK_USER\u0026gt; logstash_internal The name of the user for logstash to access Elasticsearch.   \u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; password The password for ELK_USER.   \u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; apikey The API key details.    You will also need the BASE64 version of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) that signed the certificate of the Elasticsearch server. If using a self-signed certificate, this is the self signed certificate of the Elasticsearch server. See Copying the Elasticsearch Certificate for details on how to get the correct certificate. In the example below the certificate is called elk.crt.\nCreate kubernetes secrets   Create a Kubernetes secret for Elasticsearch using the API Key or Password.\na) If ELK uses an API Key for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oigns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_APIKEY\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created b) If ELK uses a password for authentication:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic -n oigns --from-literal password=\u0026lt;ELK_PASSWORD\u0026gt; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/elasticsearch-pw-elastic created Note: It is recommended that the ELK Stack is created with authentication enabled.

to the location of the image in your container registry e.g: container-registry.example.com/logstash:8.3.1  For example:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: oig-logstash namespace: oigns spec: selector: matchLabels: k8s-app: logstash template: # create pods using pod definition in this template metadata: labels: k8s-app: logstash spec: imagePullSecrets: - name: dockercred containers: - command: - logstash image: logstash:8.3.1 imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: oig-logstash env: - name: ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: elasticsearch-pw-elastic key: password resources: ports: - containerPort: 5044 name: logstash volumeMounts: - mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume - name: shared-logs mountPath: /shared-logs - mountPath: /usr/share/logstash/pipeline/ name: oig-logstash-pipeline - mountPath: /usr/share/logstash/config/logstash.yml subPath: logstash.yml name: config-volume - mountPath: /usr/share/logstash/config/certs name: elk-cert volumes: - configMap: defaultMode: 420 items: - key: elk.crt path: elk.crt name: elk-cert name: elk-cert - configMap: defaultMode: 420 items: - key: logstash-config.conf path: logstash-config.conf name: oig-logstash-configmap name: oig-logstash-pipeline - configMap: defaultMode: 420 items: - key: logstash.yml path: logstash.yml name: oig-logstash-configmap name: config-volume - name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: governancedomain-domain-pvc - name: shared-logs emptyDir: {}   Deploy the logstash pod by executing the following command:\n$ kubectl create -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\ndeployment.apps/oig-logstash created   Run the following command to check the logstash pod is created correctly:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output should look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 90m governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 88m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 88m oig-logstash-77fbbc66f8-lsvcw 1/1 Running 0 3m25s Note: Wait a couple of minutes to make sure the pod has not had any failures or restarts. If the pod fails you can view the pod log using:\n$ kubectl logs -f oig-logstash-\u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n oigns Most errors occur due to misconfiguration of the logstash_cm.yaml or logstash.yaml. This is usually because of an incorrect value set, or the certificate was not pasted with the correct indentation.\nIf the pod has errors, delete the pod and configmap as follows:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash.yaml $ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana/logstash_cm.yaml Once you have resolved the issue in the yaml files, run the commands outlined earlier to recreate the configmap and logstash pod.\n  Verify and access the Kibana console To access the Kibana console you will need the Kibana URL as per Installing Elasticsearch (ELK) Stack and Kibana.\nFor Kibana 7.7.x and below:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Kibana \u0026gt; Index Patterns.\n  In the Create Index Pattern page enter oiglogs* for the Index pattern and click Next Step.\n  In the Configure settings page, from the Time Filter field name drop down menu select @timestamp and click Create index pattern.\n  Once the index pattern is created click on Discover in the navigation menu to view the OIG logs.\n  For Kibana version 7.8.X and above:\n  Access the Kibana console with http://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/app/kibana and login with your username and password.\n  From the Navigation menu, navigate to Management \u0026gt; Stack Management.\n  Click Data Views in the Kibana section.\n  Click Create Data View and enter the following information:\n Name: oiglogs* Timestamp: @timestamp    Click Create Data View.\n  From the Navigation menu, click Discover to view the log file entries.\n  From the drop down menu, select oiglogs* to view the log file entries.\n  "

	"tags": [],
	"description": "Describes the steps for Monitoring the OAM domain.",
	"content": "After the OAM domain is set up you can monitor the OAM instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See Monitoring a domain.\nThe WebLogic Monitoring Exporter uses the WLS RESTful Management API to scrape runtime information and then exports Prometheus-compatible metrics. It is deployed as a web application in a WebLogic Server (WLS) instance, version 12.2.1 or later, typically, in the instance from which you want to get metrics.\nThere are two ways to setup monitoring and you should choose one method or the other:\n Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh Setup using manual configuration  Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh The $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/setup-monitoring.sh sets up the monitoring for the OAM domain. It installs Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and deploys the web applications to the OAM domain. It also deploys the WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard.\nFor usage details execute ./setup-monitoring.sh -h.\n  Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/monitoring-inputs.yaml and change the domainUID, domainNamespace, and weblogicCredentialsSecretName to correspond to your deployment. Also change wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster, wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster, exposeMonitoringNodePort to true. For example:\nversion: create-accessdomain-monitoring-inputs-v1 # Unique ID identifying your domain. # This ID must not contain an underscope (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), and must be lowercase and unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. domainUID: accessdomain # Name of the domain namespace domainNamespace: oamns # Boolean value indicating whether to install kube-prometheus-stack setupKubePrometheusStack: true # Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: # Name of the monitoring namespace monitoringNamespace: monitoring # Name of the Admin Server adminServerName: AdminServer # # Port number for admin server adminServerPort: 7001 # Cluster name oamClusterName: oam_cluster # Port number for managed server oamManagedServerPort: 14100 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster: true # Cluster name policyClusterName: policy_cluster # Port number for managed server policyManagedServerPort: 15100 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster: true # Boolean to indicate if the adminNodePort will be exposed exposeMonitoringNodePort: true # NodePort to expose Prometheus prometheusNodePort: 32101 # NodePort to expose Grafana grafanaNodePort: 32100 # NodePort to expose Alertmanager alertmanagerNodePort: 32102 # Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Admin Server's username and password weblogicCredentialsSecretName: accessdomain-credentials Note: For WDT domains, weblogicCredentialsSecretName should be set to accessdomain-weblogic-credentials.\nNote: If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana or prometheus, you must load the images in a local container registry. You must then set additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack to set the location of the image in your local container registry, for example:\n# Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set grafana.image.registry=\u0026quot;container-registry.example.com\u0026quot; --set grafana.image.repository=\u0026quot;grafana/grafana\u0026quot; --set grafana.image.tag=8.3.4   Run the following command to setup monitoring.\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./setup-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml The output should be similar to the following:\nMonitoring setup in monitoring in progress node/worker-node1 not labeled node/worker-node2 not labeled node/master-node not labeled Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack started \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; has been added to your repositories Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;appscode\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈ Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack in progress W0320 \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; 19121 warnings.go:70] policy/v1beta1 PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+ W0320 \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; 19121 warnings.go:70] policy/v1beta1 PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+ W0320 \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; 19121 warnings.go:70] policy/v1beta1 PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+ ..

Change your password when prompted.\n  In the Dashboards panel, click on WebLogic Server Dashboard. The dashboard for your OAM domain should be displayed. If it is not displayed, click the Search icon in the left hand menu and search for WebLogic Server Dashboard.\n  Cleanup To uninstall the Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and the deployments, you can run the $WORKDIR/monitoring-service/kubernetes/delete-monitoring.sh script. For usage details execute ./delete-monitoring.sh -h.\n  To uninstall run the following command:\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./delete-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml $ kubectl delete namespace monitoring   Setup using manual configuration Install Prometheus, Grafana and WebLogic Monitoring Exporter manually. Create the web applications and deploy to the OAM domain.\nDeploy the Prometheus operator   Kube-Prometheus requires all nodes to be labelled with kubernetes.io/os=linux. To check if your nodes are labelled, run the following:\n$ kubectl get nodes --show-labels If the nodes are labelled the output will look similar to the following:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION LABELS worker-node1 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-node1,kubernetes.io/os=linux worker-node2 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-node2,kubernetes.io/os=linux master-node Ready master 42d v1.20.10 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=master-node,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/master= If the nodes are not labelled, run the following command:\n$ kubectl label nodes --all kubernetes.io/os=linux   Clone Prometheus by running the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ git clone https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus.git -b v0.7.0 Note: Please refer the compatibility matrix of Kube Prometheus. Please download the release of the repository according to the Kubernetes version of your cluster.\n  If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana, you must load the images in a local container registry.\nFor grafana, edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus/manifests/grafana-deployment.yaml and change image: grafana/grafana:7.3.4 to your local container registry image location, for example image: container-registry.example.com/grafana/grafana:8.3.4.\nFor any other images check the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus/manifests/*deployment.yaml files.\n  Run the following command to create the namespace and custom resource definitions:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl create -f manifests/setup The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/monitoring created

The Prometheus Operator identifies the targets using service discovery. To get the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter end point discovered as a target, you must create a service monitor pointing to the service.\nThe exporting of metrics from wls-exporter requires basicAuth, so a Kubernetes Secret is created with the user name and password that are base64 encoded. This Secret is used in the ServiceMonitor deployment. The wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml has basicAuth with credentials as username: weblogic and password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; in base64 encoded.\n  Run the following command to get the base64 encoded version of the weblogic password:\n$ echo -n \u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | base64 The output will look similar to the following:\nV2VsY29tZTE=   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml and change the password: value to the value returned above. Also change the namespace: and weblogic.domainName: values to match your OAM namespace and domain name:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: basic-auth namespace: oamns data: password: V2VsY29tZTE= user: d2VibG9naWM= type: Opaque --- apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: wls-exporter namespace: oamns labels: k8s-app: wls-exporter release: monitoring spec: namespaceSelector: matchNames: - oamns selector: matchLabels: weblogic.domainName: accessdomain endpoints: - basicAuth: password: name: basic-auth key: password username: name: basic-auth key: user port: default relabelings: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) interval: 10s honorLabels: true path: /wls-exporter/metrics   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleSpecific-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OAM namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oamns rules: - apiGroups: - \u0026quot;\u0026quot; resources: - services - endpoints - pods verbs: - get - list - watch kind: RoleList   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleBinding-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OAM namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oamns roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: prometheus-k8s subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: prometheus-k8s namespace: monitoring kind: RoleBindingList   Run the following command to enable Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests $ kubectl apply -f . The output will look similar to the following:\nrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created secret/basic-auth created servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/wls-exporter created   Prometheus Service Discovery After the ServiceMonitor is deployed, the wls-exporter should be discovered by Prometheus and be able to collect metrics.\n  Access the following URL to view Prometheus service discovery: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32101/service-discovery\n  Click on oamns/wls-exporter/0  and then show more. Verify all the targets are mentioned.\n  Grafana Dashboard   Access the Grafana dashboard with the following URL: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32100 and login with admin/admin. Change your password when prompted.\n  Import the Grafana dashboard by navigating on the left hand menu to Create \u0026gt; Import. Copy the content from $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/config/weblogic-server-dashboard-import.json and paste. Then click Load and Import. The dashboard should be displayed in the Dashboards panel.\n  Cleanup To clean up a manual installation:\n  Run the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/ $ kubectl delete -f .   Delete the deployments:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/scripts/ $ kubectl cp undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:/u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy $ kubectl exec -it -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver -- /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh /u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy/undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py -domainName \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -adminServerName AdminServer -adminURL \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:7001 -username weblogic -password \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -oamClusterName oam_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster true -policyClusterName policy_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster true   Delete Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl delete -f manifests   "

	"content": " Prerequisite configuration Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server  Troubleshooting   Deploy HPA Testing HPA Delete the HPA Other considerations  Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is supported from Weblogic Kubernetes Operator 4.0.X and later.\nHPA allows automatic scaling (up and down) of the OAM Managed Servers. If load increases then extra OAM Managed Servers will be started as required, up to the value configuredManagedServerCount defined when the domain was created (see Prepare the create domain script). Similarly, if load decreases, OAM Managed Servers will be automatically shutdown.\nFor more information on HPA, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\nThe instructions below show you how to configure and run an HPA to scale an OAM cluster (accessdomain-oam-cluster) resource, based on CPU utilization or memory resource metrics. If required, you can also perform the following for the accessdomain-policy-cluster.\nNote: If you enable HPA and then decide you want to start/stop/scale OAM Managed servers manually as per Domain Life Cycle, it is recommended to delete HPA beforehand as per Delete the HPA.\nPrerequisite configuration In order to use HPA, the OAM domain must have been created with the required resources parameter. For OAM domains created with WLST scripts, this is as per Set the OAM server memory parameters. For OAM domains created with WDT models, the values should be set by default. For example:\nserverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; If you created the OAM domain without setting these parameters, then you can update the domain using the following steps:\n  Run the following command to edit the cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster accessdomain-oam-cluster -n oamns Note: This opens an edit session for the oam-cluster where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oam_cluster. Change the entry so it looks as follows:\nspec: clusterName: oam_cluster replicas: 1 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: 8Gi requests: cpu: 1000m memory: 4Gi serverService: precreateService: true ...   Save the file and exit (:wq!)\nThe output will look similar to the following:\ncluster.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain-oam-cluster edited The OAM Managed Server pods will then automatically be restarted.\n  Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server Before deploying HPA you must deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n  Check to see if the Kubernetes Metrics Server is already deployed:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric If a row is returned as follows, then Kubernetes Metric Server is deployed and you can move to Deploy HPA.\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 5m13s   If no rows are returned by the previous command, then the Kubernetes Metric Server needs to be deployed. Run the following commands to get the components.yaml:\n$ mkdir $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml   Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/metrics-server created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created service/metrics-server created deployment.apps/metrics-server created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created   Run the following command to check Kubernetes Metric Server is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric Make sure the pod has a READY status of 1/1:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 39s   Troubleshooting If the Kubernetes Metric Server does not reach the READY 1/1 state, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system $ kubectl logs \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system If you see errors such as:\nReadiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500 and:\nE0907 13:07:50.937308 1 scraper.go:140] \u0026quot;Failed to scrape node\u0026quot; err=\u0026quot;Get \\\u0026quot;https://100.105.18.113:10250/metrics/resource\\\u0026quot;: x509: cannot validate certificate for 100.105.18.113 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs\u0026quot; node=\u0026quot;worker-node1\u0026quot; then you may need to install a valid cluster certificate for your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor testing purposes, you can resolve this issue by:\n  Delete the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml   Edit the $WORKDIR/hpa/components.yaml and locate the args: section. Add kubelet-insecure-tls to the arguments. For example:\nspec: containers: - args: - --cert-dir=/tmp - --secure-port=4443 - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname - --kubelet-use-node-status-port - --kubelet-insecure-tls - --metric-resolution=15s image: registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.6.4 ...   Deploy the Kubenetes Metrics Server using the command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml Run the following and make sure the READY status shows 1/1:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric The output should look similar to the following:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 40s   Deploy HPA The steps below show how to configure and run an HPA to scale the accessdomain-oam-cluster, based on the CPU or memory utilization resource metrics.\nThe default OAM deployment creates the cluster accessdomain-oam-cluster which starts one OAM Managed Server (oam_server1). The deployment also creates, but doesn’t start, four extra OAM Managed Servers (oam-server2 to oam-server5).\nIn the following example an HPA resource is created, targeted at the cluster resource accessdomain-oam-cluster. This resource will autoscale OAM Managed Servers from a minimum of 1 cluster member up to 5 cluster members. Scaling up will occur when the average CPU is consistently over 70%. Scaling down will occur when the average CPU is consistently below 70%.\n  Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa and create an autoscalehpa.yaml file that contains the following.\n# apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa namespace: oamns spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v1 kind: Cluster name: accessdomain-oam-cluster behavior: scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 scaleUp: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 5 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70 Note : minReplicas and maxReplicas should match your current domain settings.\nNote: For setting HPA based on Memory Metrics, update the metrics block with the following content. Please note we recommend using only CPU or Memory, not both.\nmetrics: - type: Resource resource: name: memory target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70   Run the following command to create the autoscaler:\n$ kubectl apply -f autoscalehpa.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa created   Verify the status of the autoscaler by running the following:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa Cluster/accessdomain-oam-cluster 5%/70% 1 5 1 21s In the example above, this shows that CPU is currently running at 5% for the accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa.\n  Testing HPA   Check the current status of the OAM Managed Servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 0/1 Running 0 141m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 0/1 Running 0 138m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 138m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-5f9bdf4c9-f5trt 1/1 Running 0 4h33m In the above, only accessdomain-oam-server1 is running.\n  To test HPA can scale up the WebLogic cluster accessdomain-oam-cluster, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty accessdomain-oam-server1 -n oamns -- /bin/bash This will take you inside a bash shell inside the oam_server1 pod:\n[oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ Inside the bash shell, run the following command to increase the load on the CPU:\n[oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null This command will continue to run in the foreground.\n  In a command window outside the bash shell, run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa Cluster/accessdomain-oam-cluster 470%/70% 1 5 1 21s In the above example the CPU has increased to 470%. As this is above the 70% limit, the autoscaler increases the replicas on the Cluster resource and the operator responds by starting additional cluster members.\n  Run the following to see if any more OAM Managed Servers are started:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 0/1 Running 143m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 0/1 Running 0 140m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 140m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3m20s accessdomain-oam-server3 1/1 Running 0 3m20s accessdomain-oam-server4 1/1 Running 0 3m19s accessdomain-oam-server5 1/1 Running 0 3m5s In the example above four more OAM Managed Servers have been started (oam-server2 - oam-server5).\nNote: It may take some time for the servers to appear and start. Once the servers are at READY status of 1/1, the servers are started.\n  To stop the load on the CPU, in the bash shell, issue a Control C, and then exit the bash shell:\n[oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null ^C [oracle@accessdomain-oam-server1 oracle]$ exit   Run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE accessdomain-oam-cluster-hpa Cluster/accessdomain-oam-cluster 19%/70% 1 5 5 19m In the above example CPU has dropped to 19%. As this is below the 70% threshold, you should see the autoscaler scale down the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 152m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 149m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 149m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 14m accessdomain-oam-server3 0/1 Terminating 0 14m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-5f9bdf4c9-f5trt 1/1 Running 0 4h45m Eventually, all the servers except oam-server1 will disappear:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 154m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 151m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 151m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-5f9bdf4c9-f5trt 1/1 Running 0 4h47m   Delete the HPA   If you need to delete the HPA, you can do so by running the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ kubectl delete -f autoscalehpa.yaml   Other considerations  If HPA is deployed and you need to upgrade the OAM image, then you must delete the HPA before upgrading. Once the upgrade is successful you can deploy HPA again. If you choose to start/stop an OAM Managed Server manually as per Domain Life Cycle, then it is recommended to delete the HPA before doing so.  "

	"description": "Describes the steps for Monitoring the OIG domain and Publishing the logs to Elasticsearch.",
	"content": "After the OIG domain is set up you can monitor the OIG instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See Monitoring a domain.\nThe WebLogic Monitoring Exporter uses the WLS RESTful Management API to scrape runtime information and then exports Prometheus-compatible metrics. It is deployed as a web application in a WebLogic Server (WLS) instance, version 12.2.1 or later, typically, in the instance from which you want to get metrics.\nThere are two ways to setup monitoring and you should choose one method or the other:\n Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh Setup using manual configuration  Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh The $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/setup-monitoring.sh sets up the monitoring for the OIG domain. It installs Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and deploys the web applications to the OIG domain. It also deploys the WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard.\nFor usage details execute ./setup-monitoring.sh -h.\n  Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/monitoring-inputs.yaml and change the domainUID, domainNamespace, and weblogicCredentialsSecretName to correspond to your deployment. Also change wlsMonitoringExporterTosoaCluster, wlsMonitoringExporterTooimCluster, exposeMonitoringNodePort to true. For example:\nversion: create-governancedomain-monitoring-inputs-v1 # Unique ID identifying your domain. # This ID must not contain an underscope (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), and must be lowercase and unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. domainUID: governancedomain # Name of the domain namespace domainNamespace: oigns # Boolean value indicating whether to install kube-prometheus-stack setupKubePrometheusStack: true # Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: # Name of the monitoring namespace monitoringNamespace: monitoring # Name of the Admin Server adminServerName: AdminServer # # Port number for admin server adminServerPort: 7001 # Cluster name soaClusterName: soa_cluster # Port number for managed server soaManagedServerPort: 8001 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTosoaCluster: true # Cluster name oimClusterName: oim_cluster # Port number for managed server oimManagedServerPort: 14000 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTooimCluster: true # Boolean to indicate if the adminNodePort will be exposed exposeMonitoringNodePort: true # NodePort to expose Prometheus prometheusNodePort: 32101 # NodePort to expose Grafana grafanaNodePort: 32100 # NodePort to expose Alertmanager alertmanagerNodePort: 32102 # Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Admin Server's username and password weblogicCredentialsSecretName: governancedomain-weblogic-credentials Note: For WDT domains, weblogicCredentialsSecretName should be set to governancedomain-weblogic-credentials.\nNote: If your cluster does not have access to the internet to pull external images, such as grafana or prometheus, you must load the images in a local container registry. You must then set additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack to set the location of the image in your local container registry, for example:\n# Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set grafana.image.registry=\u0026quot;container-registry.example.com\u0026quot; --set grafana.image.repository=\u0026quot;grafana/grafana\u0026quot; --set grafana.image.tag=8.3.4   Run the following command to setup monitoring:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./setup-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml The output should be similar to the following:\nMonitoring setup in monitoring in progress node/worker-node1 not labeled node/worker-node2 not labeled node/master-node not labeled Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack started \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; already exists with the same configuration, skipping Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈ Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack in progress NAME: monitoring LAST DEPLOYED: \u0026lt;DATE\u0026gt; NAMESPACE: monitoring STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 NOTES: kube-prometheus-stack has been installed.

The Prometheus Operator identifies the targets using service discovery. To get the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter end point discovered as a target, you must create a service monitor pointing to the service.\nThe exporting of metrics from wls-exporter requires basicAuth, so a Kubernetes Secret is created with the user name and password that are base64 encoded. This Secret is used in the ServiceMonitor deployment. The wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml has basicAuth with credentials as username: weblogic and password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; in base64 encoded.\n  Run the following command to get the base64 encoded version of the weblogic password:\n$ echo -n \u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | base64 The output will look similar to the following:\nV2VsY29tZTE=   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml and change the password: value to the value returned above. Also change any reference to the namespace and weblogic.domainName: values to match your OIG namespace and domain name. For example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: basic-auth namespace: oigns data: password: V2VsY29tZTE= user: d2VibG9naWM= type: Opaque --- apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: wls-exporter namespace: oigns labels: k8s-app: wls-exporter release: monitoring spec: namespaceSelector: matchNames: - oigns selector: matchLabels: weblogic.domainName: governancedomain endpoints: - basicAuth: password: name: basic-auth key: password username: name: basic-auth key: user port: default relabelings: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) interval: 10s honorLabels: true path: /wls-exporter/metrics   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleSpecific-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OIG namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oigns rules: - apiGroups: - \u0026quot;\u0026quot; resources: - services - endpoints - pods verbs: - get - list - watch kind: RoleList   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleBinding-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OIG namespace.

	"content": " Prerequisite configuration Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server  Troubleshooting   Deploy HPA Testing HPA Delete the HPA Other considerations  Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is supported from Weblogic Kubernetes Operator 4.0.X and later.\nHPA allows automatic scaling (up and down) of the OIG Managed Servers. If load increases then extra OIG Managed Servers will be started as required, up to the value configuredManagedServerCount defined when the domain was created (see Prepare the create domain script). Similarly, if load decreases, OIG Managed Servers will be automatically shutdown.\nFor more information on HPA, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\nThe instructions below show you how to configure and run an HPA to scale an OIG cluster (governancedomain-oim-cluster) resource, based on CPU utilization or memory resource metrics. If required, you can also perform the following for the governancedomain-soa-cluster.\nNote: If you enable HPA and then decide you want to start/stop/scale OIG Managed servers manually as per Domain Life Cycle, it is recommended to delete HPA beforehand as per Delete the HPA.\nPrerequisite configuration In order to use HPA, the OIG domain must have been created with the required resources parameter as per Set the OIM server memory parameters. For example:\nserverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026quot;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m\u0026quot; resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;8Gi\u0026quot; requests: cpu: \u0026quot;1000m\u0026quot; memory: \u0026quot;4Gi\u0026quot; If you created the OIG domain without setting these parameters, then you can update the domain using the following steps:\n  Run the following command to edit the cluster:\n$ kubectl edit cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster -n oigns Note: This opens an edit session for the governancedomain-oim-cluster where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session, search for spec:, and then look for the replicas parameter under clusterName: oim_cluster. Change the entry so it looks as follows:\nspec: clusterName: oim_cluster replicas: 1 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: -XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m resources: limits: cpu: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; memory: 8Gi requests: cpu: 1000m memory: 4Gi serverService: precreateService: true ...   Save the file and exit (:wq!)\nThe output will look similar to the following:\ncluster.weblogic.oracle/governancedomain-oim-cluster edited The OIG Managed Server pods will then automatically be restarted.\n  Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server Before deploying HPA you must deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n  Check to see if the Kubernetes Metrics Server is already deployed:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric If a row is returned as follows, then Kubernetes Metric Server is deployed and you can move to Deploy HPA.\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 5m13s   If no rows are returned by the previous command, then the Kubernetes Metric Server needs to be deployed. Run the following commands to get the components.yaml:\n$ mkdir $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml   Deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/metrics-server created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created service/metrics-server created deployment.apps/metrics-server created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created   Run the following command to check Kubernetes Metric Server is running:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric Make sure the pod has a READY status of 1/1:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 39s   Troubleshooting If the Kubernetes Metric Server does not reach the READY 1/1 state, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system $ kubectl logs \u0026lt;metrics-server-pod\u0026gt; -n kube-system If you see errors such as:\nReadiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500 and:\nE0907 13:07:50.937308 1 scraper.go:140] \u0026quot;Failed to scrape node\u0026quot; err=\u0026quot;Get \\\u0026quot;https://100.105.18.113:10250/metrics/resource\\\u0026quot;: x509: cannot validate certificate for 100.105.18.113 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs\u0026quot; node=\u0026quot;worker-node1\u0026quot; then you may need to install a valid cluster certificate for your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor testing purposes, you can resolve this issue by:\n  Delete the Kubernetes Metrics Server by running the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml   Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa/components.yaml and locate the args: section. Add kubelet-insecure-tls to the arguments. For example:\nspec: containers: - args: - --cert-dir=/tmp - --secure-port=4443 - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname - --kubelet-use-node-status-port - --kubelet-insecure-tls - --metric-resolution=15s image: registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.6.4 ...   Deploy the Kubenetes Metrics Server using the command:\n$ kubectl apply -f components.yaml Run the following and make sure the READY status shows 1/1:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metric The output should look similar to the following:\nmetrics-server-d9694457-mf69d 1/1 Running 0 40s   Deploy HPA The steps below show how to configure and run an HPA to scale the governancedomain-oim-cluster, based on the CPU or memory utilization resource metrics.\nThe default OIG deployment creates the cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster which starts one OIG Managed Server (oim_server1). The deployment also creates, but doesn’t start, four extra OIG Managed Servers (oim-server2 to oim-server5).\nIn the following example an HPA resource is created, targeted at the cluster resource governancedomain-oim-cluster. This resource will autoscale OIG Managed Servers from a minimum of 1 cluster member up to 5 cluster members. Scaling up will occur when the average CPU is consistently over 70%. Scaling down will occur when the average CPU is consistently below 70%.\n  Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa and create an autoscalehpa.yaml file that contains the following.\n# apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa namespace: oigns spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v1 kind: Cluster name: governancedomain-oim-cluster behavior: scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 scaleUp: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60 minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 5 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70 Note : minReplicas and maxReplicas should match your current domain settings.\nNote: For setting HPA based on Memory Metrics, update the metrics block with the following content. Please note we recommend using only CPU or Memory, not both.\nmetrics: - type: Resource resource: name: memory target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 70   Run the following command to create the autoscaler:\n$ kubectl apply -f autoscalehpa.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa created   Verify the status of the autoscaler by running the following:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa Cluster/governancedomain-oim-cluster 16%/70% 1 5 1 20s In the example above, this shows that CPU is currently running at 16% for the governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa.\n  Testing HPA   Check the current status of the OIG Managed Servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 20m governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 17m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 17m In the above only governancedomain-oim-server1 is running.\n  To test HPA can scale up the WebLogic cluster governancedomain-oim-cluster, run the following commands:\n$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty governancedomain-oim-server1 -n oigns -- /bin/bash This will take you inside a bash shell inside the oim_server1 pod:\n[oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ Inside the bash shell, run the following command to increase the load on the CPU:\n[oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null This command will continue to run in the foreground.\n  In a command window outside the bash shell, run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa Cluster/governancedomain-oim-cluster 386%/70% 1 5 1 2m47s In the above example the CPU has increased to 386%. As this is above the 70% limit, the autoscaler increases the replicas on the Cluster resource and the operator responds by starting additional cluster members.\n  Run the following to see if any more OIG Managed Servers are started:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 30m governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 27m governancedomain-oim-server2 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-oim-server3 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-oim-server4 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-oim-server5 1/1 Running 0 10m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 27m In the example above four more OIG Managed Servers have been started (oim-server2 - oim-server5).\nNote: It may take some time for the servers to appear and start. Once the servers are at READY status of 1/1, the servers are started.\n  To stop the load on the CPU, in the bash shell, issue a Control C, and then exit the bash shell:\n[oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null ^C [oracle@governancedomain-oim-server1 oracle]$ exit   Run the following command to view the current CPU usage:\n$ kubectl get hpa -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE governancedomain-oim-cluster-hpa Cluster/governancedomain-oim-cluster 33%/70% 1 5 5 37m In the above example CPU has dropped to 33%. As this is below the 70% threshold, you should see the autoscaler scale down the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oigns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 43m governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 40m governancedomain-oim-server2 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server3 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server4 1/1 Running 0 13m governancedomain-oim-server5 0/1 Terminating 0 13m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 40m Eventually, all the servers except oim-server1 will disappear:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE governancedomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 44m governancedomain-oim-server1 1/1 Running 0 41m governancedomain-soa-server1 1/1 Running 0 41m   Delete the HPA   If you need to delete the HPA, you can do so by running the following command:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/hpa $ kubectl delete -f autoscalehpa.yaml   Other considerations  If HPA is deployed and you need to upgrade the OIG image, then you must delete the HPA before upgrading. Once the upgrade is successful you can deploy HPA again. If you choose to start/stop an OIG Managed Server manually as per Domain Life Cycle, then it is recommended to delete the HPA before doing so.  "
