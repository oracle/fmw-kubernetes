Securing a Kubernetes cluster involves hardening on multiple fronts - securing the API servers, etcd, nodes, container images, container run-time, and the cluster network. Apply principles of defense in depth, principle of least privilege, and minimize the attack surface. Use security tools such as [Kube-Bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) to verify the clusterâ€™s security posture. Since Kubernetes is evolving rapidly, refer to [Kubernetes Security Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/) for the latest information on securing a Kubernetes cluster. Also ensure the deployed Docker containers follow the [Docker Security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/) guidance.

This section provides references on how to securely configure Docker and Kubernetes.
