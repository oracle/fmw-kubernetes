The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator supports deployment of Oracle Access Management (OAM).

In this release, OAM domains are supported using the “domain on a persistent volume”
[model](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/) only, where the domain home is located in a persistent volume (PV).

The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator has several key features to assist you with deploying and managing Oracle Access Management domains in a Kubernetes
environment. You can:



* Create OAM instances in a Kubernetes persistent volume. This persistent volume can reside in an NFS file system or other Kubernetes volume types.
* Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states.
* Expose the OAM Services through external access.
* Scale OAM domains by starting and stopping Managed Servers on demand.
* Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.
* Monitor the OAM instance using Prometheus and Grafana.
