# Mount path where the deploy artifacts scripts are located inside a pod
#
# The `deploy-artifacts.sh` script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the
# `deployScriptName` property) in a Kubernetes pod to deploy artifacts into respective cluster. Files
# in the `deployScriptFilesDir` directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that
# a Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to deploy artifacts.
deployScriptsMountPath: /u01/weblogic

# Script that deploys artifacts into the Cluster
#
# The `deploy-artifacts.sh` script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to deploy
# artifacts into respective cluster. The script is located in the in-pod directory that
# is specified in the `deployScriptsMountPath` property.
#
# If you need to provide your own scripts to deploy the artifacts, instead of using the
# built-in scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want
# the deploy artifacts job to run.
deployScriptName: deploy.sh

# Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to deploy artifacts
# It contains the script that is specified in the `deployScriptName` property.
#
# By default, this directory is set to the relative path `deploy`, and the deploy artifacts script will
# use the built-in deploy.sh scripts in the `deploy` directory to deploy artifacts into the cluster.
#
# An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system.
#
# The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or files as long
# as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a
# Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the `deployScriptsMountPath`,
# so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files for deploying artifacts.
