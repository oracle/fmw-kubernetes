# autoinstall.cfg for the UCM instance
#
# autoinstall.cfg is used to avoid the need to restart the Content Server after
# making changes on the post install config page in 11g for UCM/IBR topologies.
# After install and before startup of managed server.
# The content server will read in this file at next start up and merge in the configuration
# and will look for certain entries that tell it to enable certain components.
