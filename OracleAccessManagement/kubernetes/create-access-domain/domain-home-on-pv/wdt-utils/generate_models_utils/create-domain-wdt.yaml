## When weblogicDomainStorageType is set to NFS, then weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer should be set
## to the IP address or name of the DNS server, and this value should be set to the exported path
## on that server.
## Note that the path where the domain is mounted in the WebLogic containers is not affected by this
