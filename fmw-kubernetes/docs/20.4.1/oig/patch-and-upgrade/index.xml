      <description>To update your OIG Kubernetes cluster with a new OIG Docker image, first install the new Docker image on all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.
Once the new image is installed choose one of the following options to update your OIG Kubernetes cluster to use the new image:
 Run the kubectl edit domain command Run the kubectl patch domain command  In all of the above cases, the Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Operator will restart the Administration Server pod first and then perform a rolling restart on the OIG Managed Servers.</description>

      <description>These instructions apply to upgrading operators within the 3.x release family as additional versions are released.
The new Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Docker image must be installed on the master node AND each of the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can place the image in a Docker registry that your cluster can access.
   Pull the Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 3.X.X image by running the following command on the master node:</description>

      <description>These instructions describe how to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster created using kubeadm on which an OIG domain is deployed. A rolling upgrade approach is used to upgrade nodes (master and worker) of the Kubernetes cluster.
It is expected that there will be a down time during the upgrade of the Kubernetes cluster as the nodes need to be drained as part of the upgrade process.
 Prerequisites  Review Prerequisites and ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is ready for upgrade.</description>
