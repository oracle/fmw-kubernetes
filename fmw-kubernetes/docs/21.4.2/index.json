	"content": "This section provides information about the system requirements and limitations for deploying and running Oracle SOA Suite domains with the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nSystem requirements for Oracle SOA Suite domains For the current production release 21.4.2:\n Operating systems supported:  Oracle Linux 7 (UL6+) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (UL3+ only with standalone Kubernetes) Oracle Linux Cloud Native Environment (OLCNE) version 1.3.   Kubernetes 1.16.15+, 1.17.13+, 1.18.10+, 1.19.7+, and 1.20.6+ (check with kubectl version). Docker 18.9.1 or 19.03.1+ (check with docker version) or CRI-O 1.20.2+ (check with crictl version | grep RuntimeVersion). Flannel networking v0.9.1-amd64 or later (check with docker images | grep flannel), Calico networking v3.16.1 or later. Helm 3.3.4+ (check with helm version --client --short). WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 3.3.0 (see the operator releases page). Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4 Docker image downloaded from My Oracle Support (MOS patch 33467899). This image contains the latest bundle patch and one-off patches for Oracle SOA Suite. You must have the cluster-admin role to install the operator. The operator does not need the cluster-admin role at runtime. For more information, see the role-based access control (RBAC) documentation. We do not currently support running SOA in non-Linux containers. Additionally, see the Oracle SOA Suite documentation for other requirements such as database version.  See here for resource sizing information for Oracle SOA Suite domains set up on a Kubernetes cluster.\nLimitations Compared to running a WebLogic Server domain in Kubernetes using the operator, the following limitations currently exist for Oracle SOA Suite domains:\n In this release, Oracle SOA Suite domains are supported using the domain on a persistent volume model only, where the domain home is located in a persistent volume (PV). The \u0026ldquo;domain in image\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;model in image\u0026rdquo; models are not supported. Also, \u0026ldquo;WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT)\u0026rdquo; based deployments are currently not supported. Only configured clusters are supported. Dynamic clusters are not supported for Oracle SOA Suite domains. Note that you can still use all of the scaling features, but you need to define the maximum size of your cluster at domain creation time. Mixed clusters (configured servers targeted to a dynamic cluster) are not supported. The WebLogic Logging Exporter currently supports WebLogic Server logs only. Other logs will not be sent to Elasticsearch. Note, however, that you can use a sidecar with a log handling tool like Logstash or Fluentd to get logs. The WebLogic Monitoring Exporter currently supports WebLogic MBean trees only. Support for JRF and Oracle SOA Suite MBeans is not available. Also, a metrics dashboard specific to Oracle SOA Suite is not available. Instead, use the WebLogic Server dashboard to monitor the Oracle SOA Suite server metrics in Grafana. Some features such as multicast, multitenancy, production redeployment, and Node Manager (although it is used internally for the liveness probe and to start WebLogic Server instances) are not supported in this release. Features such as Java Messaging Service whole server migration, consensus leasing, and maximum availability architecture (Oracle SOA Suite EDG setup) are not supported in this release. Enabling or disabling the memory resiliency for Oracle Service Bus using the Enterprise Manager Console is not supported in this release. Zero downtime upgrade (ZDT) of the domain is not supported.  For up-to-date information about the features of WebLogic Server that are supported in Kubernetes environments, see My Oracle Support Doc ID 2349228.1.\n"

	"description": "Deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper to Oracle SOA Suite in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment.",
	"content": "Learn how to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper (running outside the Kubernetes network) to an Oracle SOA Suite instance in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment.\nUse JDeveloper for development and test environments only. For a production environment, you should deploy using Application Control and WLST methods.\n Deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications to Oracle SOA Suite from JDeveloper To deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications from Oracle JDeveloper, the Administration Server must be configured to expose a T3 channel. The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator provides an option to expose a T3 channel for the Administration Server using the exposeAdminT3Channel setting during domain creation, then the matching T3 service can be used to connect. By default, when exposeAdminT3Channel is set, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment exposes the NodePort for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint at 30012 (use t3ChannelPort to configure the port to a different value).\nIf you miss enabling exposeAdminT3Channel during domain creation, follow Expose a T3/T3S Channel for the Administration Server to expose a T3 channel manually.\nPrerequisites   Get the Kubernetes cluster master address and verify the T3 port that will be used for creating application server connections. Use the following command to get the T3 port:\n$ kubectl get service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;AdministrationServerName\u0026gt;-external -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;-o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}' For example:\n$ kubectl get service soainfra-adminserver-external -n soans -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'   Oracle SOA Suite in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment is deployed in a Reference Configuration domain. If a SOA project is developed in Classic mode JDeveloper displays a Mismatch notification in the Deploy Composite Wizard. By default, JDeveloper is in Classic mode. To develop SOA projects in Reference Configuration mode, you must manually enable this feature in JDeveloper: a. From the File menu, select Tools, then Preferences. b. Select Reference Configuration Settings. c. Select Enable Reference Configuration settings in adapters.\n  JDeveloper needs to access the Servers during deployment. In the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment, Administration and Managed Servers are pods and cannot be accessed directly by JDeveloper. As a workaround, you must configure the reachability of the Managed Servers:\nThe Managed Server T3 port is not exposed by default and opening this will have a security risk as the authentication method here is based on a userid/password. It is not recommended to do this on production instances.\n   Decide on an external IP address to be used to configure access to the Managed Servers. Master or worker node IP address can be used to configure Managed Server reachability. In these steps, the Kubernetes cluster master IP is used for demonstration.\n  Get the pod names of the Administration Server and Managed Servers (that is, \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;server name\u0026gt;), which will be used to map in /etc/hosts.\n  Update /etc/hosts (or in Windows, C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts) on the host where JDeveloper is running with the entries below, where\n\u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Administration Server pod name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Managed Server1 pod name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Managed Server2 pod name\u0026gt; Sample /etc/hosts entries looks as follows, where X.X.X.X is the master node IP address:\nX.X.X.X soainfra-adminserver X.X.X.X soainfra-soa-server1 X.X.X.X soainfra-soa-server2   Get the Kubernetes service name of the Oracle SOA Suite cluster to access externally with the master IP (or external IP):\n$ kubectl get service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get service soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster -n soans   Create a Kubernetes service to expose the Oracle SOA Suite cluster service (\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt;) externally with same port as the Managed Server:\n$ kubectl expose service \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt; --name \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;soa-cluster\u0026gt;-ext --external-ip=\u0026lt;Master IP\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl expose service soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster --name soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster-ext --external-ip=X.X.X.X -n soans  In a production environment, exposing the SOA cluster service with an external IP address is not recommended, as it can cause message drops on the SOA Managed Servers.\n     Create an application server connection in JDeveloper   Create a new application server connection (for example wls-k8s-op-connection) in JDeveloper:   In the configuration page, provide the WebLogic Hostname as the Kubernetes Master Address.\n  Update the Port as the T3 port (default is 30012) obtained in Prerequisites.\n  Enter the WebLogic Domain value (domainUID).\n  Test the connection to verify it is successful.   Deploy SOA composite applications using JDeveloper   In JDeveloper, right-click the SOA project you want to deploy and select Deploy to display the deployment wizard.   In the Deployment Action page, select Deploy to Application Server and click Next.   In the Deployment Configuration page, select the appropriate options and click Next.   In the Select server page, select the application server connection (wls-k8s-op-connection) that was created earlier and click Next.   If the Prerequisites were configured correctly, the lookup discovers the Managed Servers for deploying the composite.   Using the application server connection, the Managed Servers (Oracle SOA Suite cluster) are listed on the SOA Servers page. Select the Oracle SOA Suite cluster and click Next.   On the Summary page, click Finish to start deploying the composites to the Oracle SOA Suite cluster.   Verify logs on JDeveloper to confirm successful deployment.   Enter the soa-infra URLs in a browser to confirm the composites are deployed on both servers of the Oracle SOA Suite cluster.   Deploy Oracle Service Bus composite applications using JDeveloper   In JDeveloper, right-click the Oracle Service Bus project you want to deploy and select Deploy to display the deployment wizard.   In the Deployment Action page, select Deploy to Application Server and click Next.   In the Select Server page, select the application server connection (wls-k8s-op-connection) that was created earlier and click Next.   On the Summary page, click Finish to start deploying the composites to the Oracle Service Bus cluster.   In JDeveloper, verify logs to confirm successful deployment.   In the Oracle Service Bus Console, click Launch Test Console to verify that the Oracle Service Bus composite application is deployed successfully.   "

However, if you need to create images with new bundle and interim patches, you can build these images using the WebLogic Image Tool.\nIf you have access to the Oracle SOA Suite patches, you can patch an existing Oracle SOA Suite image with a bundle patch and interim patches. Oracle recommends that you use the WebLogic Image Tool to patch the Oracle SOA Suite image.\n Recommendations:\n Use the WebLogic Image Tool create feature for patching the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a bundle patch and multiple interim patches. This is the recommended approach because it optimizes the size of the image. Use the WebLogic Image Tool update feature for patching the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Apply the patched Oracle SOA Suite image To update an Oracle SOA Suite domain with a patched image, first make sure the patched image is pulled or created and available on the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Once the patched image is available, you can follow these steps to update the Oracle SOA Suite domain with a patched image:\n Stop all servers Update user permissions of the domain PV storage Address post-installation requirements Apply the patched image  Stop all servers  Note: The following steps are applicable only for non-Zero Downtime Patching. For Zero Downtime Patching, go to Address post-installation requirements.\n Before applying the patch, stop all servers in the domain:\n  In the domain.yaml configuration file, update the spec.serverStartPolicy field value to NEVER.\n  Shut down the domain (stop all servers) by applying the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml   Update user permissions of the domain PV storage The Oracle SOA Suite image for release 21.4.2 has an oracle user with UID 1000, with the default group set to root. Before applying the patched image, update the user permissions of the domain persistent volume (PV) to set the group to root:\n$ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA Address post-installation requirements If the patches in the patched Oracle SOA Suite image have any post-installation steps, follow these steps:\n Create a Kubernetes pod with domain home access Perform post-installation steps  Create a Kubernetes pod with domain home access   Get domain home persistence volume claim details for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nFor example, to list the persistent volume claim details in the namespace soans:\n$ kubectl get pvc -n soans Sample output showing the persistent volume claim is soainfra-domain-pvc:\nNAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE soainfra-domain-pvc Bound soainfra-domain-pv 10Gi RWX soainfra-domain-storage-class xxd   Create a YAML soapostinstall.yaml using the domain home persistence volume claim.\nFor example, using soainfra-domain-pvc per the sample output:\n Note: Replace soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841 with the patched image in the following sample YAML:\n apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: run: soapostinstall name: soapostinstall namespace: soans spec: containers: - image: soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841 name: soapostinstall command: [\u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sleep infinity\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects volumes: - name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soainfra-domain-pvc   Apply the YAML to create the Kubernetes pod:\n$ kubectl apply -f soapostinstall.yaml   Perform post-installation steps If you need to perform any post-installation steps on the domain home:\n  Start a bash shell in the soapostinstall pod:\n$ kubectl exec -it -n soans soapostinstall -- bash This opens a bash shell in the running soapostinstall pod:\n[oracle@soapostinstall oracle]$   Use the bash shell of the soapostinstall pod and perform the required steps on the domain home.\n  After successful completion of the post-installation steps, you can delete the soapostinstall pod:\n$ kubectl delete -f soapostinstall.yaml   Apply the patched image After completing the required SOA schema upgrade and post-installation steps, start up the domain:\n  In the domain.yaml configuration file, update the image field value with the patched image:\nFor example:\n image: soasuite:12.2.1.4-30761841   In case of non-Zero Downtime Patching, update the spec.serverStartPolicy field value to IF_NEEDED in domain.yaml.\n  Apply the updated domain.yaml configuration file to start up the domain.\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: In case of non-Zero Downtime Patching, the complete domain startup happens, as the servers in the domain were stopped earlier.

Here path-based routing is used for ingress. Sample values for default configuration are shown in the file ${WORKDIR}/charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml. By default, type is TRAEFIK, sslType is NONSSL, and domainType is soa. These values can be overridden by passing values through the command line or can be edited in the sample file values.yaml based on the type of configuration (NONSSL, SSL, and E2ESSL).\nIf needed, you can update the ingress YAML file to define more path rules (in section spec.rules.host.http.paths) based on the domain application URLs that need to be accessed.

This involves the following steps:\n Create Kubernetes Namespace Create Secrets for User IDs and Passwords Prepare a host directory to be used for Filesystem based PersistentVolume Create PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for your Namespace  Note: Sample files to assist you in creating and configuring your Oracle Unified Directory Kubernetes environment can be found in the project at the following location:\nhttps://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes/tree/master/OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/samples\nCreate Kubernetes Namespace You should create a Kubernetes namespace to provide a scope for other objects such as pods and services that you create in the environment. To create your namespace you should refer to the oudns.yaml file.\nUpdate the oudns.yaml file and replace %NAMESPACE% with the value of the namespace you would like to create. In the example below the value \u0026lsquo;oudns\u0026rsquo; is used.\nTo create the namespace apply the file using kubectl:\n$ cd \u0026lt;work directory\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/samples $ kubectl apply -f oudns.yaml For example:\n$ cd /scratch/OUDContainer/fmw-kubernetes/OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/samples $ kubectl apply -f oudns.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/oudns created Confirm that the namespace is created:\n$ kubectl get namespaces NAME STATUS AGE default Active 4d kube-public Active 4d kube-system Active 4d oudns Active 53s Create Secrets for User IDs and Passwords To protect sensitive information, namely user IDs and passwords, you should create Kubernetes Secrets for the key-value pairs with following keys. The Secret with key-value pairs will be used to pass values to containers created through the Oracle Unified Directory image:\n rootUserDN rootUserPassword adminUID adminPassword bindDN1 bindPassword1 bindDN2 bindPassword2  There are two ways by which a Kubernetes secret object can be created with required key-value pairs.\nUsing secrets.yaml file In this method you update the secrets.yaml file with the value for %SECRET_NAME% and %NAMESPACE%, together with the Base64 value for each secret.\n %rootUserDN% - With Base64 encoded value for rootUserDN parameter. %rootUserPassword% - With Base64 encoded value for rootUserPassword parameter. %adminUID% - With Base64 encoded value for adminUID parameter. %adminPassword% - With Base64 encoded value for adminPassword parameter. %bindDN1% - With Base64 encoded value for bindDN1 parameter. %bindPassword1% - With Base64 encoded value for bindPassword1 parameter. %bindDN2% - With Base64 encoded value for bindDN2 parameter. %bindPassword2% - With Base64 encoded value for bindPassword2 parameter.  Obtain the base64 value for your secrets, for example:\n$ echo -n cn=Directory Manager | base64 Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI= $ echo -n Oracle123 | base64 T3JhY2xlMTIz $ echo -n admin | base64 YWRtaW4= Note: Ensure that you use the -n parameter with the echo command. If the parameter is omitted Base64 values willbe generated with a new-line character included.\nUpdate the secrets.yaml file with your values. It should look similar to the file shown below:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: oudsecret namespace: oudns type: Opaque data: rootUserDN: Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI= rootUserPassword: T3JhY2xlMTIz adminUID: YWRtaW4= adminPassword: T3JhY2xlMTIz bindDN1: Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI= bindPassword1: T3JhY2xlMTIz bindDN2: Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI= bindPassword2: T3JhY2xlMTIz Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml secret/oudsecret created Verify that the secret has been created:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get secret NAME TYPE DATA AGE default-token-fztcb kubernetes.io/service-account-token 3 15m oudsecret Opaque 8 99s Using kubectl create secret command The Kubernetes secret can be created using the command line with the following syntax:\n$ kubectl --namespace %NAMESPACE% create secret generic %SECRET_NAME% \\ --from-literal=rootUserDN=\u0026quot;%rootUserDN%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=rootUserPassword=\u0026quot;%rootUserPassword%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=adminUID=\u0026quot;%adminUID%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=adminPassword=\u0026quot;%adminPassword%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=bindDN1=\u0026quot;%bindDN1%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=bindPassword1=\u0026quot;%bindPassword1%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=bindDN2=\u0026quot;%bindDN2%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=bindPassword2=\u0026quot;%bindPassword2%\u0026quot; Update the following placeholders in the command with the relevant value:\n %NAMESPACE% - With name of namespace in which secret is required to be created %SECRET_NAME% - Name for the secret object %rootUserDN% - With Base64 encoded value for rootUserDN parameter. %rootUserPassword% - With Base64 encoded value for rootUserPassword parameter. %adminUID% - With Base64 encoded value for adminUID parameter. %adminPassword% - With Base64 encoded value for adminPassword parameter. %bindDN1% - With Base64 encoded value for bindDN1 parameter. %bindPassword1% - With Base64 encoded value for bindPassword1 parameter. %bindDN2% - With Base64 encoded value for bindDN2 parameter. %bindPassword2% - With Base64 encoded value for bindPassword2 parameter.  After executing the kubectl create secret command, verify that the secret has been created:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get secret NAME TYPE DATA AGE default-token-fztcb kubernetes.io/service-account-token 3 15m oudsecret Opaque 8 99s Prepare a Host Directory to be used for Filesystem Based PersistentVolume It is required to prepare a directory on the Host filesystem to store Oracle Unified Directory Instances and other configuration outside the container filesystem. That directory from the Host filesystem will be associated with a PersistentVolume.\nIn the case of a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, the Host directory to be associated with the PersistentVolume should be accessible on all the nodes at the same path.\nTo prepare a Host directory (for example: /scratch/user_projects) for mounting as a file system based PersistentVolume inside your containers, execute the command below on your Host:\n The userid can be anything but it must have uid:guid as 1000:1000, which is the same as the \u0026lsquo;oracle\u0026rsquo; user running in the container.

To provide storage for your namespace, update the persistent-volume.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %PV_NAME% PV name oudpv   %PV_HOST_PATH% Valid path on localhost /scratch/user_projects   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudpvc   %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f persistent-volume.yaml persistentvolume/oudpv created persistentvolumeclaim/oudpvc created Verify the PersistentVolume:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns describe persistentvolume oudpv Name: oudpv Labels: type=oud-pv Annotations: pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: yes Finalizers: [kubernetes.io/pv-protection] StorageClass: manual Status: Bound Claim: oudns/oudpvc Reclaim Policy: Retain Access Modes: RWX VolumeMode: Filesystem Capacity: 10Gi Node Affinity: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Message: Source: Type: HostPath (bare host directory volume) Path: /scratch/user_projects HostPathType: Events: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Verify the PersistentVolumeClaim:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns describe pvc oudpvc Name: oudpvc Namespace: oudns StorageClass: manual Status: Bound Volume: oudpv Labels: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Annotations: pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed: yes pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: yes Finalizers: [kubernetes.io/pvc-protection] Capacity: 10Gi Access Modes: RWX VolumeMode: Filesystem Mounted By: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Events: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Directory Server (instanceType=Directory) In this example you create a POD (oudpod1) which comprises a single container based on an Oracle Unified Directory 12c PS4 (12.2.1.4.0) image.\nTo create the POD update the oud-dir-pod.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns   %IMAGE% Oracle image tag oracle/oud:12.2.1.4.0   %SECRET_NAME% Secret name oudsecret   %PV_NAME% PV name oudpv   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudpvc    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f oud-dir-pod.yaml pod/oudpod1 created To check the status of the created pod:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oudpod1 1/1 Running 0 14m If you see any errors then use the following commands to debug the pod/container.\nTo review issues with the pod e.g. CreateContainerConfigError:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; describe pod \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns describe pod oudpod1 To tail the container logs while it is initializing use the following command:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; logs -f -c \u0026lt;container\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns logs -f -c oudds1 oudpod1 To view the full container logs:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; logs -c \u0026lt;container\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; To validate that the Oracle Unified Directory directory server instance is running, connect to the container:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns exec -it -c oudds1 oudpod1 /bin/bash In the container, run ldapsearch to return entries from the directory server:\n$ cd /u01/oracle/user_projects/oudpod1/OUD/bin $ ./ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \u0026quot;cn=Directory Manager\u0026quot; -w Oracle123 -b \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -s sub \u0026quot;(objectclass=*)\u0026quot; dn dn: dc=example1,dc=com dn: ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com ... dn: uid=user.99,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com To exit the bash session type exit.\nDirectory Server (instanceType=Directory) as a Kubernetes Service In this example you will create two pods and 2 associated containers, both running Oracle Unified Directory 12c Directory Server instances. This demonstrates how you can expose Oracle Unified Directory 12c as a network service. This provides a way of abstracting access to the backend service independent of the pod details.\nTo create the POD update the oud-dir-svc.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns   %IMAGE% Oracle image tag oracle/oud:12.2.1.4.0   %SECRET_NAME% Secret name oudsecret   %PV_NAME% PV name oudpv   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudpvc    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f oud-dir-svc.yaml service/oud-dir-svc-1 created pod/oud-dir1 created service/oud-dir-svc-2 created pod/oud-dir2 created To check the status of the created pods (oud-dir1 and oud-dir2) and services (oud-dir-svc-1 and oud-dir-svc-2):\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get all NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/oud-dir1 1/1 Running 0 28m pod/oud-dir2 1/1 Running 0 28m pod/oudpod1 1/1 Running 0 22h NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/oud-dir-svc-1 NodePort 10.107.171.235 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30616/TCP,1888:32605/TCP,1389:31405/TCP,1636:32544/TCP,1080:31509/TCP,1081:32395/TCP,1898:31116/TCP 28m service/oud-dir-svc-2 NodePort 10.106.206.229 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30882/TCP,1888:30427/TCP,1389:31299/TCP,1636:31529/TCP,1080:30056/TCP,1081:30458/TCP,1898:31796/TCP 28m From this example you can see that the following service port mappings are available to access the container:\n service/oud-dir-svc-1 : 10.107.171.235 : 1389:31405 service/oud-dir-svc-2 : 10.106.206.229 : 1389:31299  To access the Oracle Unified Directory directory server running in pod/oud-dir1 via the LDAP port 1389 you would use the service port : 31405.\nTo access the Oracle Unified Directory directory server running in pod/oud-dir2 via the LDAP port 1389 you would use the service port : 31299.\nFor example:\nNote: use the ldapsearch from the Oracle Unified Directory ORACLE_HOME when accessing the cluster externally.\n$ ldapsearch -h $HOSTNAME -p 31405 -D \u0026quot;cn=Directory Manager\u0026quot; -w Oracle123 -b \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -s sub \u0026quot;(objectclass=*)\u0026quot; dn dn: dc=example1,dc=com dn: ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com ... dn: uid=user.98,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com dn: uid=user.99,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com $ ldapsearch -h $HOSTNAME -p 31299 -D \u0026quot;cn=Directory Manager\u0026quot; -w Oracle123 -b \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -s sub \u0026quot;(objectclass=*)\u0026quot; dn dn: dc=example2,dc=com dn: ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com ... dn: uid=user.98,ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com dn: uid=user.99,ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com Validation It is possible to access the Oracle Unified Directory instances and the data within externally from the cluster, using commands like curl. In this way you can access interfaces exposed through NodePort. In the example below, two services (service/oud-dir-svc-1 and service/oud-dir-svc-2) expose a set of ports. The following curl commands can be executed against the ports exposed through each service.\nCurl command example for Oracle Unified Directory Admin REST: curl --noproxy \u0026quot;*\u0026quot; --insecure --location --request GET \\ 'https://\u0026lt;HOSTNAME\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;AdminHttps NodePort mapped to 1888\u0026gt;/rest/v1/admin/?scope=base\u0026amp;attributes=%2b' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Basic Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI6T3JhY2xlMTIz' where Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI6T3JhY2xlMTIz is the base64 encoded version of : cn=Directory Manager:Oracle123\nCurl command example for Oracle Unified Directory Data REST : curl --noproxy \u0026quot;*\u0026quot; --insecure --location --request GET \\ 'https://\u0026lt;HOSTNAME\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;Https NodePort mapped to 1081\u0026gt;/rest/v1/directory/?scope=base\u0026amp;attributes=%2b' \\ --header 'Authorization: Basic Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI6T3JhY2xlMTIz' Curl command example for Oracle Unified Directory Data SCIM: curl --noproxy \u0026quot;*\u0026quot; --insecure --location --request GET \\ 'https://\u0026lt;HOSTNAME\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;Https NodePort mapped to 1081\u0026gt;/iam/directory/oud/scim/v1/Schemas/urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Schema' \\ --header 'Authorization: Basic Y249RGlyZWN0b3J5IE1hbmFnZXI6T3JhY2xlMTIz' Proxy Server (instanceType=Proxy) as a Kubernetes Service In this example you will create a service, pod and associated container, in which an Oracle Unified Directory 12c Proxy Server instance is deployed. This acts as a proxy to the 2 services you created in the previous example.\nTo create the POD update the oud-ds_proxy-svc.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns   %IMAGE% Oracle image tag oracle/oud:12.2.1.4.0   %SECRET_NAME% Secret name oudsecret   %PV_NAME% PV name oudpv   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudpvc    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f oud-ds_proxy-svc.yaml service/oud-ds-proxy-svc created pod/oudp1 created Check the status of the new pod/service:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get all NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/oud-dir1 1/1 Running 0 166m pod/oud-dir2 1/1 Running 0 166m pod/oudp1 1/1 Running 0 20m pod/oudpod1 1/1 Running 0 25h NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/oud-dir-svc-1 NodePort 10.107.171.235 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30616/TCP,1888:32605/TCP,1389:31405/TCP,1636:32544/TCP,1080:31509/TCP,1081:32395/TCP,1898:31116/TCP 166m service/oud-dir-svc-2 NodePort 10.106.206.229 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30882/TCP,1888:30427/TCP,1389:31299/TCP,1636:31529/TCP,1080:30056/TCP,1081:30458/TCP,1898:31796/TCP 166m service/oud-ds-proxy-svc NodePort 10.103.41.171 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30878/TCP,1888:30847/TCP,1389:31810/TCP,1636:30873/TCP,1080:32076/TCP,1081:30762/TCP,1898:31269/TCP 20m Verify operation of the proxy server, accessing through the external service port:\n$ ldapsearch -h $HOSTNAME -p 31810 -D \u0026quot;cn=Directory Manager\u0026quot; -w Oracle123 -b \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -s sub \u0026quot;(objectclass=*)\u0026quot; dn dn: dc=example1,dc=com dn: ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com ... dn: uid=user.99,ou=People,dc=example1,dc=com dn: dc=example2,dc=com dn: ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com dn: uid=user.0,ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com ... dn: uid=user.98,ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com dn: uid=user.99,ou=People,dc=example2,dc=com Note: Entries are returned from both backend directory servers (dc=example1,dc=com and dc=example2,dc=com) via the proxy server.\nReplication Server (instanceType=Replication) as a Kubernetes Service In this example you will create a service, pod and associated container, in which an Oracle Unified Directory 12c Replication Server instance is deployed. This creates a single Replication Server which has 2 Directory Servers as its replication group. This example extends the Oracle Unified Directory instances created as part of Directory Server (instanceType=Directory) as a Kubernetes Service.\nTo create the POD update the oud-ds_rs_ds-svc.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns   %IMAGE% Oracle image tag oracle/oud:12.2.1.4.0   %SECRET_NAME% Secret name oudsecret   %PV_NAME% PV name oudpv   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudpvc    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f oud-ds_rs_ds-svc.yaml service/oud-rs-svc-1 created pod/oudpodrs1 created service/oud-ds-svc-1a created pod/oudpodds1a created service/oud-ds-svc-1b created pod/oudpodds1b created Check the status of the new services:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get all NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/oud-dir1 1/1 Running 0 2d20h pod/oud-dir2 1/1 Running 0 2d20h pod/oudp1 1/1 Running 0 2d18h pod/oudpod1 1/1 Running 0 3d18h pod/oudpodds1a 0/1 Running 0 2m44s pod/oudpodds1b 0/1 Running 0 2m44s pod/oudpodrs1 0/1 Running 0 2m45s NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/oud-dir-svc-1 NodePort 10.107.171.235 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30616/TCP,1888:32605/TCP,1389:31405/TCP,1636:32544/TCP,1080:31509/TCP,1081:32395/TCP,1898:31116/TCP 2d20h service/oud-dir-svc-2 NodePort 10.106.206.229 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30882/TCP,1888:30427/TCP,1389:31299/TCP,1636:31529/TCP,1080:30056/TCP,1081:30458/TCP,1898:31796/TCP 2d20h service/oud-ds-proxy-svc NodePort 10.103.41.171 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30878/TCP,1888:30847/TCP,1389:31810/TCP,1636:30873/TCP,1080:32076/TCP,1081:30762/TCP,1898:31269/TCP 2d18h service/oud-ds-svc-1a NodePort 10.102.218.25 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:30347/TCP,1888:30392/TCP,1389:32482/TCP,1636:31161/TCP,1080:31241/TCP,1081:32597/TCP 2m45s service/oud-ds-svc-1b NodePort 10.104.6.215 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:32031/TCP,1888:31621/TCP,1389:32511/TCP,1636:31698/TCP,1080:30737/TCP,1081:30748/TCP 2m44s service/oud-rs-svc-1 NodePort 10.110.237.193 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 1444:32685/TCP,1888:30176/TCP,1898:30543/TCP 2m45s Validation To validate that the Oracle Unified Directory replication group is running, connect to the replication server container (oudrs1):\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns exec -it -c oudrs1 oudpodrs1 /bin/bash $ cd /u01/oracle/user_projects/oudpodrs1/OUD/bin In the container, run dsreplication to return details of the replication group:\n$ ./dsreplication status --trustAll --hostname localhost --port 1444 --adminUID admin --dataToDisplay compat-view --dataToDisplay rs-connections \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Specify Oracle Unified Directory LDAP connection parameters Password for user 'admin': Establishing connections and reading configuration .....

This involves the following steps:\n Create Kubernetes Namespace Create Secrets for User IDs and Passwords Prepare a host directory to be used for Filesystem based PersistentVolume Create PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for your Namespace  Create Kubernetes Namespace You should create a Kubernetes namespace to provide a scope for other objects such as pods and services that you create in the environment. To create your namespace you should refer to the oudsmns.yaml file.\nUpdate the oudsmns.yaml file and replace %NAMESPACE% with the value of the namespace you would like to create. In the example below the value \u0026lsquo;oudns\u0026rsquo; is used.\nTo create the namespace apply the file using kubectl:\n$ kubectl apply -f oudsmns.yaml namespace/oudns created Confirm that the namespace is created:\n$ kubectl get namespaces NAME STATUS AGE default Active 4d kube-public Active 4d kube-system Active 4d oudns Active 53s Create Secrets for User IDs and Passwords To protect sensitive information, namely user IDs and passwords, you should create Kubernetes Secrets for the key-value pairs with following keys. The Secret with key-value pairs will be used to pass values to containers created through the OUD image:\n adminUser adminPass  There are two ways by which a Kubernetes secret object can be created with required key-value pairs.\nUsing samples/secrets.yaml file In this method you update the samples/secrets.yaml file with the value for %SECRET_NAME% and %NAMESPACE%, together with the Base64 value for each secret.\n %adminUser% - With Base64 encoded value for adminUser parameter. %adminPass% - With Base64 encoded value for adminPass parameter.  Obtain the base64 value for your secrets, for example:\n$ echo -n weblogic | base64 d2VibG9naWM= $ echo -n Oracle123 | base64 T3JhY2xlMTIz Note: Ensure that you use the -n parameter with the echo command. If the parameter is omitted Base64 values will be generated with a new-line character included.\nUpdate the secrets.yaml file with your values. It should look similar to the file shown below:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: oudsmsecret namespace: oudns type: Opaque data: adminUser: d2VibG9naWM= adminPass: T3JhY2xlMTIz Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml secret/oudsmsecret created Verify that the secret has been created:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get secret NAME TYPE DATA AGE default-token-fztcb kubernetes.io/service-account-token 3 15m oudsmsecret Opaque 8 99s Using kubectl create secret command The Kubernetes secret can be created using the command line with the following syntax:\n$ kubectl --namespace %NAMESPACE% create secret generic %SECRET_NAME% \\ --from-literal=adminUser=\u0026quot;%adminUser%\u0026quot; \\ --from-literal=adminPass=\u0026quot;%adminPass%\u0026quot; Update the following placeholders in the command with the relevant value:\n %NAMESPACE% - With name of namespace in which secret is required to be created %SECRET_NAME% - Name for the secret object %adminUser% - With Base64 encoded value for adminUser parameter. %adminPass%- With Base64 encoded value for adminPass parameter.  After executing the kubectl create secret command, verify that the secret has been created:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get secret NAME TYPE DATA AGE default-token-fztcb kubernetes.io/service-account-token 3 15m oudsmsecret Opaque 8 99s Prepare a Host Directory to be used for Filesystem Based PersistentVolume It is required to prepare a directory on the Host filesystem to store Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Instances and other configuration outside the container filesystem. That directory from the Host filesystem will be associated with a PersistentVolume.\nIn the case of a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, the Host directory to be associated with the PersistentVolume should be accessible on all the nodes at the same path.\nTo prepare a Host directory (for example: /scratch/user_projects) for mounting as a file system based PersistentVolume inside your containers, execute the command below on your Host:\n The userid can be anything but it must have uid:guid as 1000:1000, which is the same as the \u0026lsquo;oracle\u0026rsquo; user running in the container. This ensures the \u0026lsquo;oracle\u0026rsquo; user has access to the shared volume/directory.\n $ sudo su - root $ mkdir -p /scratch/user_projects $ chown 1000:1000 /scratch/user_projects $ exit All container operations are performed as the oracle user.\nNote: If a user already exists with -u 1000 -g 1000 then use the same user. Else modify the existing user to have uid-gid as '-u 1000 -g 1000\u0026rsquo;\nCreate PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for your Namespace A PersistentVolume (PV) is a storage resource, while a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for that resource. To provide storage for your namespace, update the persistent-volume.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %PV_NAME% PV name oudsmpv   %PV_HOST_PATH% Valid path on localhost /scratch/user_projects   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudsmpvc   %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f persistent-volume.yaml persistentvolume/oudsmpv created persistentvolumeclaim/oudsmpvc created Verify the PersistentVolume:\n$ kubectl describe persistentvolume oudsmpv Name: oudsmpv Labels: type=oud-pv Annotations: pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: yes Finalizers: [kubernetes.io/pv-protection] StorageClass: manual Status: Bound Claim: oudns/oudsmpvc Reclaim Policy: Retain Access Modes: RWX VolumeMode: Filesystem Capacity: 10Gi Node Affinity: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Message: Source: Type: HostPath (bare host directory volume) Path: /scratch/user_projects HostPathType: Events: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Verify the PersistentVolumeClaim:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns describe pvc oudsmpvc Name: oudsmpvc Namespace: oudns StorageClass: manual Status: Bound Volume: oudsmpv Labels: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Annotations: pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed: yes pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: yes Finalizers: [kubernetes.io/pvc-protection] Capacity: 10Gi Access Modes: RWX VolumeMode: Filesystem Mounted By: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Events: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager POD In this example you create a POD (oudsmpod) which holds a single container based on an Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager 12c PS4 (12.2.1.4.0) image. This container is configured to run Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager. You also create a service (oudsm) through which you can access the Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager GUI.\nTo create the POD update the samples/oudsm-pod.yaml file.\nUpdate the following parameters to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns   %IMAGE% Oracle image tag oracle/oudsm:12.2.1.4.0   %SECRET_NAME% Secret name oudsmsecret   %PV_NAME% PV name oudsmpv   %PVC_NAME% PVC name oudsmpvc    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f samples/oudsm-pod.yaml service/oudsm-svc created pod/oudsmpod created To check the status of the created pod:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oudns NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE oudsmpod 1/1 Running 0 22m If you see any errors then use the following commands to debug the pod/container.\nTo review issues with the pod e.g. CreateContainerConfigError:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; describe pod \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns describe pod oudsmpod To tail the container logs while it is initialising use the following command:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; logs -f -c \u0026lt;container\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns logs -f -c oudsm oudsmpod To view the full container logs:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; logs -c \u0026lt;container\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; To validate that the POD is running:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; get all,pv,pvc,secret For example:\n$ kubectl --namespace oudns get all,pv,pvc,secret NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/oudsmpod 1/1 Running 0 24m NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/oudsm-svc NodePort 10.109.142.163 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt;

deleted pod \u0026quot;oudsmpod\u0026quot; deleted This will avoid conflicts when running the following example for Deployments.\nOracle Unified Directory Services Manager Deployment In this example you create multiple Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager PODs/Services using Kubernetes deployments.\nTo create the deployment update the samples/oudsm-deployment.yaml file.\nUpdate the following to values specific to your environment:\n   Param Value Example     %NAMESPACE% Namespace oudns   %IMAGE% Oracle image tag oracle/oudsm:12.2.1.4.0   %SECRET_NAME% Secret name oudsmsecret    Apply the file:\n$ kubectl apply -f samples/oudsm-deployment.yaml service/oudsm created deployment.apps/oudsmdeploypod created To validate that the POD is running:\n$ kubectl --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;

Note that this walkthrough is for demonstration purposes only, not for use in production. These instructions assume that you are already familiar with Kubernetes. If you need more detailed instructions, refer to the Install Guide.\nHardware requirements The Linux kernel supported for deploying and running Oracle SOA Suite domains with the operator is Oracle Linux 7 (UL6+) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (UL3+ only with standalone Kubernetes). Refer to the prerequisites for more details.\nFor this exercise, the minimum hardware requirements to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster and then deploy the soaosb (Oracle SOA Suite, Oracle Service Bus, and Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)) domain type with one Managed Server for Oracle SOA Suite and one for the Oracle Service Bus cluster, along with Oracle Database running as a container are:\n   Hardware Size     RAM 32GB   Disk Space 250GB+   CPU core(s) 6    See here for resource sizing information for Oracle SOA Suite domains set up on a Kubernetes cluster.\nSet up Oracle SOA Suite in an on-premise environment Use the steps in this topic to create a single-instance on-premise Kubernetes cluster and then create an Oracle SOA Suite soaosb domain type, which deploys a domain with Oracle SOA Suite, Oracle Service Bus, and Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS).\n Step 1 - Prepare a virtual machine for the Kubernetes cluster Step 2 - Set up a single instance Kubernetes cluster Step 3 - Get scripts and images Step 4 - Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Step 5 - Install the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer Step 6 - Create and configure an Oracle SOA Suite domain  1. Prepare a virtual machine for the Kubernetes cluster For illustration purposes, these instructions are for Oracle Linux 7u6+. If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to adjust the steps accordingly.\nThese steps must be run with the root user, unless specified otherwise. Any time you see YOUR_USERID in a command, you should replace it with your actual userid.\n 1.1 Prerequisites   Choose the directories where your Docker and Kubernetes files will be stored. The Docker directory should be on a disk with a lot of free space (more than 100GB) because it will be used for the Docker file system, which contains all of your images and containers. The Kubernetes directory is used for the /var/lib/kubelet file system and persistent volume storage.\n$ export docker_dir=/u01/docker $ export kubelet_dir=/u01/kubelet $ mkdir -p $docker_dir $kubelet_dir $ ln -s $kubelet_dir /var/lib/kubelet   Verify that IPv4 forwarding is enabled on your host.\nNote: Replace eth0 with the ethernet interface name of your compute resource if it is different.\n$ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding\u0026#39; $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding\u0026#39; $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding\u0026#39; $ /sbin/sysctl -a 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|grep -s \u0026#39;net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind\u0026#39; For example: Verify that all are set to 1:\n$ net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding = 1 $ net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1 Solution: Set all values to 1 immediately:\n$ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.docker0.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.lo.forwarding=1 $ /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1   To preserve the settings permanently: Update the above values to 1 in files in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/, /run/sysctl.d/, and /etc/sysctl.d/.\n  Verify the iptables rule for forwarding.\nKubernetes uses iptables to handle many networking and port forwarding rules.

The Docker daemon pulled the \u0026#34;hello-world\u0026#34; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

Set up a single instance Kubernetes cluster  Notes:\n These steps must be run with the root user, unless specified otherwise! If you choose to use a different CIDR block (that is, other than 10.244.0.0/16 for the --pod-network-cidr= in the kubeadm init command), then also update NO_PROXY and no_proxy with the appropriate value.  Also make sure to update kube-flannel.yaml with the new value before deploying.   Replace the following with appropriate values:  ADD-YOUR-INTERNAL-NO-PROXY-LIST REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-COMPANY-PROXY-HOST:PORT     2.1 Set up the master node   Create a shell script that sets up the necessary environment variables. You can append this to the user’s .bashrc so that it will run at login.

Then set up the ~/.bashrc similar to steps 1 to 3 with YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP.\n Note that from now on we will be using YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP to execute any kubectl commands and not root.\n   Set up YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP to access the Kubernetes cluster:\n$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube $ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config $ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config   Verify that YOUR_USERID:YOUR_GROUP is set up to access the Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl command:\n$ kubectl get nodes  Note: At this step, the node is not in ready state as we have not yet installed the pod network add-on. After the next step, the node will show status as Ready.\n   Install a pod network add-on (flannel) so that your pods can communicate with each other.\n Note: If you are using a different CIDR block than 10.244.0.0/16, then download and update kube-flannel.yml with the correct CIDR address before deploying into the cluster:\n $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/v0.12.0/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml   Verify that the master node is in Ready status:\n$ kubectl get nodes Sample output:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION mymasternode Ready master 8m26s v1.18.4 or:\n$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system Sample output:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/coredns-86c58d9df4-58p9f 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/coredns-86c58d9df4-mzrr5 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/etcd-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 3m4s pod/kube-apiserver-node 1/1 Running 0 3m21s pod/kube-controller-manager-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 3m25s pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-6npx4 1/1 Running 0 49s pod/kube-proxy-4vsgm 1/1 Running 0 3m59s pod/kube-scheduler-mymasternode 1/1 Running 0 2m58s   To schedule pods on the master node, taint the node:\n$ kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-   Congratulations!

Get scripts and images 3.1 Set up the code repository to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains Follow these steps to set up the source code repository required to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains.\n3.2 Get required Docker images and add them to your local registry   Pull the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator image:\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 $ docker tag ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0   Obtain the Oracle Database image and Oracle SOA Suite Docker image from the Oracle Container Registry:\na. For first time users, to pull an image from the Oracle Container Registry, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in using the Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication service. If you do not already have SSO credentials, you can create an Oracle Account using: https://profile.oracle.com/myprofile/account/create-account.jspx.\nUse the web interface to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions for the Oracle software images that you intend to deploy. Your acceptance of these terms are stored in a database that links the software images to your Oracle Single Sign-On login credentials.\nTo obtain the image, log in to the Oracle Container Registry:\n$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com b. Find and then pull the Oracle Database image for 12.2.0.1:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim c. Find and then pull the prebuilt Oracle SOA Suite image 12.2.1.4 install image:\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4  Note: This image does not contain any Oracle SOA Suite product patches and can only be used for test and development purposes.\n   4. Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.1 Prepare for the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.   Create a namespace opns for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns   Create a service account op-sa for the operator in the operator’s namespace:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa   4.2 Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Use Helm to install and start the operator from the directory you just cloned:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator \\  --namespace opns \\  --set image=oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 \\  --set serviceAccount=op-sa \\  --set \u0026#34;domainNamespaces={}\u0026#34; \\  --wait 4.3 Verify the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator   Verify that the operator’s pod is running by listing the pods in the operator’s namespace. You should see one for the operator:\n$ kubectl get pods -n opns   Verify that the operator is up and running by viewing the operator pod\u0026rsquo;s logs:\n$ kubectl logs -n opns -c weblogic-operator deployments/weblogic-operator   The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator v3.3.0 has been installed. Continue with the load balancer and Oracle SOA Suite domain setup.\n5. Install the Traefik (ingress-based) load balancer The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator supports these load balancers: Traefik, NGINX, and Apache. Samples are provided in the documentation.\nThis Quick Start demonstrates how to install the Traefik ingress controller to provide load balancing for an Oracle SOA Suite domain.\n  Create a namespace for Traefik:\n$ kubectl create namespace traefik   Set up Helm for 3rd party services:\n$ helm repo add traefik https://containous.github.io/traefik-helm-chart   Install the Traefik operator in the traefik namespace with the provided sample values:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install traefik traefik/traefik \\  --namespace traefik \\  --values charts/traefik/values.yaml \\  --set \u0026#34;kubernetes.namespaces={traefik}\u0026#34; \\  --set \u0026#34;service.type=NodePort\u0026#34; \\  --wait   6. Create and configure an Oracle SOA Suite domain 6.1 Prepare for an Oracle SOA Suite domain   Create a namespace that can host Oracle SOA Suite domains:\n$ kubectl create namespace soans   Use Helm to configure the operator to manage Oracle SOA Suite domains in this namespace:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator \\  --reuse-values \\  --namespace opns \\  --set \u0026#34;domainNamespaces={soans}\u0026#34; \\  --wait   Create Kubernetes secrets.\na. Create a Kubernetes secret for the domain in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain. In this example, the username is weblogic, the password is Welcome1, and the namespace is soans:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh \\  -u weblogic \\  -p Welcome1 \\  -n soans \\  -d soainfra \\  -s soainfra-domain-credentials b. Create a Kubernetes secret for the RCU in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n Schema user : SOA1 Schema password : Oradoc_db1 DB sys user password : Oradoc_db1 Domain name : soainfra Domain Namespace : soans Secret name : soainfra-rcu-credentials  $ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-credentials $ ./create-rcu-credentials.sh \\  -u SOA1 \\  -p Oradoc_db1 \\  -a sys \\  -q Oradoc_db1 \\  -d soainfra \\  -n soans \\  -s soainfra-rcu-credentials   Create the Kubernetes persistence volume and persistence volume claim.\na. Create the Oracle SOA Suite domain home directory. Determine if a user already exists on your host system with uid:gid of 1000:0:\n$ sudo getent passwd 1000 If this command returns a username (which is the first field), you can skip the following useradd command. If not, create the oracle user with useradd:\n$ sudo useradd -u 1000 -g 0 oracle Create the directory that will be used for the Oracle SOA Suite domain home:\n$ sudo mkdir /scratch/k8s_dir $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/k8s_dir b. The create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml has the following values by default:\n baseName: domain domainUID: soainfra namespace: soans weblogicDomainStoragePath: /scratch/k8s_dir  Review and update if any changes required.\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ vim create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml c. Run the create-pv-pvc.sh script to create the PV and PVC configuration files:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ ./create-pv-pvc.sh -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml -o output d. Create the PV and PVC using the configuration files created in the previous step:\n$ kubectl create -f output/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f output/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pvc.yaml   Install and configure the database for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nThis step is required only when a standalone database is not already set up and you want to use the database in a container.\nThe Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1). For production, it is suggested to use a standalone database. This example provides steps to create the database in a container.\n a. Create a database in a container:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-oracle-db-service $ ./start-db-service.sh -i container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim -p none Once the database is successfully created, you can use the database connection string oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s as an rcuDatabaseURL parameter in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file.\nb. Create Oracle SOA Suite schemas for the domain type (for example, soaosb).\nTo install the Oracle SOA Suite schemas, run the create-rcu-schema.sh script with the following inputs:\n -s \u0026lt;RCU PREFIX\u0026gt; -t \u0026lt;SOA domain type\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;Oracle Database URL\u0026gt; -i \u0026lt;SOASuite image\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;Namespace\u0026gt; -q \u0026lt;SYSDBA Database password\u0026gt; -r \u0026lt;Schema password\u0026gt; -c \u0026lt;Comma-separated variables\u0026gt; -l \u0026lt;Timeout limit in seconds. (optional). (default: 300)\u0026gt;  For example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-schema $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh \\ -s SOA1 \\ -t soaosb \\ -d oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s \\ -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.4 \\ -n default \\ -q Oradoc_db1 \\ -r Oradoc_db1 \\ -c SOA_PROFILE_TYPE=SMALL,HEALTHCARE_INTEGRATION=NO   Now the environment is ready to start the Oracle SOA Suite domain creation.\n6.2 Create an Oracle SOA Suite domain   The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at OracleSOASuite/create-soa-domain.

Create a namespace for an Oracle SOA Suite domain\nb. Create a persistent storage for an Oracle SOA Suite domain\nc. Create a Kubernetes secret with domain credentials\nd. Create a Kubernetes secret with the RCU credentials\ne. Configure access to your database\nf. Run the Repository Creation Utility to set up your database schemas\n  Create an Oracle SOA Suite domain\n  Set up your Kubernetes cluster Refer the official Kubernetes set up documentation to set up a production grade Kubernetes cluster.\nInstall Helm The operator uses Helm to create and deploy the necessary resources and then run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. For Helm installation and usage information, see here.\nGet dependent images Obtain dependent images and add them to your local registry.\n  For first time users, to pull an image from the Oracle Container Registry, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in using the Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication service. If you do not already have an SSO account, you can create an Oracle Account here.\nUse the web interface to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions for the Oracle software images that you intend to deploy. Your acceptance of these terms are stored in a database that links the software images to your Oracle Single Sign-On login credentials.\nLog in to the Oracle Container Registry (container-registry.oracle.com) from your Docker client:\n$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com   Pull the operator image:\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 $ docker tag ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0   Set up the code repository to deploy Oracle SOA Suite domains Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment on Kubernetes leverages the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator infrastructure. To deploy an Oracle SOA Suite domain, you must set up the deployment scripts.\n  Create a working directory to set up the source code:\n$ mkdir $HOME/soa_21.4.2 $ cd $HOME/soa_21.4.2   Download the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator source code and Oracle SOA Suite Kubernetes deployment scripts from the SOA repository. Required artifacts are available at OracleSOASuite/kubernetes.\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/21.4.2 $ export WORKDIR=$HOME/soa_21.4.2/OracleSOASuite/kubernetes   Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image The Oracle SOA Suite image with latest bundle patch and required interim patches can be obtained from My Oracle Support (MOS). This is the only image supported for production deployments. Follow the below steps to download the Oracle SOA Suite image from My Oracle Support.\n  Download patch 33467899 from My Oracle Support (MOS).\n  Unzip the downloaded patch zip file.\n  Load the image archive using the docker load command.\nFor example:\n$ docker load \u0026lt; soasuite-12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-211129.1734.tar Loaded image: oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-211129.1734 $   Run the docker inspect command to verify that the downloaded image is the latest released image. The value of label com.oracle.weblogic.imagetool.buildid must match to 2fd643ce-8ada-4841-9a0a-ed369cc08023.\nFor example:\n$ docker inspect --format=\u0026#39;{{ index .Config.Labels \u0026#34;com.oracle.weblogic.imagetool.buildid\u0026#34; }}\u0026#39; oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-211129.1734 2fd643ce-8ada-4841-9a0a-ed369cc08023 $   If you want to build and use an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with any additional bundle patch or interim patches that are not part of the image obtained from My Oracle Support, then follow these steps to create the image.\n Note: The default Oracle SOA Suite image name used for Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment is soasuite:12.2.1.4. The image obtained must be tagged as soasuite:12.2.1.4 using the docker tag command. If you want to use a different name for the image, make sure to update the new image tag name in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file and also in other instances where the soasuite:12.2.1.4 image name is used.\n Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator supports the deployment of Oracle SOA Suite domains in the Kubernetes environment. Follow the steps in this document to install the operator.\n Note: Optionally, you can execute these steps to send the contents of the operator’s logs to Elasticsearch.\n In the following example commands to install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, opns is the namespace and op-sa is the service account created for the Operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns $ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa $ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator --namespace opns --set image=oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 --set serviceAccount=op-sa --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={}\u0026quot; --set \u0026quot;javaLoggingLevel=FINE\u0026quot; --wait Prepare the environment for Oracle SOA Suite domains Create a namespace for an Oracle SOA Suite domain Create a Kubernetes namespace (for example, soans) for the domain unless you intend to use the default namespace. Use the new namespace in the remaining steps in this section. For details, see Prepare to run a domain.\n$ kubectl create namespace soans $ helm upgrade --reuse-values --namespace opns --set \u0026quot;domainNamespaces={soans}\u0026quot; --wait weblogic-kubernetes-operator charts/weblogic-operator Create a persistent storage for an Oracle SOA Suite domain In the Kubernetes namespace you created, create the PV and PVC for the domain by running the create-pv-pvc.sh script. Follow the instructions for using the script to create a dedicated PV and PVC for the Oracle SOA Suite domain.\n  Review the configuration parameters for PV creation here. Based on your requirements, update the values in the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file located at ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc/. Sample configuration parameter values for an Oracle SOA Suite domain are:\n baseName: domain domainUID: soainfra namespace: soans weblogicDomainStorageType: HOST_PATH weblogicDomainStoragePath: /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA    Ensure that the path for the weblogicDomainStoragePath property exists and have the ownership for 1000:0. If not, you need to create it as follows:\n$ sudo mkdir /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA $ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /scratch/k8s_dir/SOA   Run the create-pv-pvc.sh script:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ ./create-pv-pvc.sh -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml -o output_soainfra   The create-pv-pvc.sh script will create a subdirectory pv-pvcs under the given /path/to/output-directory directory and creates two YAML configuration files for PV and PVC. Apply these two YAML files to create the PV and PVC Kubernetes resources using the kubectl create -f command:\n$ kubectl create -f output_soainfra/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f output_soainfra/pv-pvcs/soainfra-domain-pvc.yaml   Create a Kubernetes secret with domain credentials Create the Kubernetes secrets username and password of the administrative account in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain:\n $ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p Welcome1 -n soans -d soainfra -s soainfra-domain-credentials For more details, see this document.\nYou can check the secret with the kubectl get secret command.\nFor example:\n  Click here to see the sample secret description.   $ kubectl get secret soainfra-domain-credentials -o yaml -n soans apiVersion: v1 data: password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_username: c3lz username: U09BMQ== kind: Secret metadata: creationTimestamp: \u0026quot;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026quot; labels: weblogic.domainName: soainfra weblogic.domainUID: soainfra managedFields: - apiVersion: v1 fieldsType: FieldsV1 fieldsV1: f:data: .: {} f:password: {} f:sys_password: {} f:sys_username: {} f:username: {} f:metadata: f:labels: .: {} f:weblogic.domainName: {} f:weblogic.domainUID: {} f:type: {} manager: kubectl operation: Update time: \u0026quot;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026quot; name: soainfra-rcu-credentials namespace: soans resourceVersion: \u0026quot;265386\u0026quot; selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-rcu-credentials uid: 2d93941c-656b-43a4-8af2-78ca8be0f293 type: Opaque    Create a Kubernetes secret with the RCU credentials You also need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials for the database schemas. When you create your domain, it will obtain the RCU credentials from this secret.\nUse the provided sample script to create the secret:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-credentials $ ./create-rcu-credentials.sh \\  -u SOA1 \\  -p Oradoc_db1 \\  -a sys \\  -q Oradoc_db1 \\  -d soainfra \\  -n soans \\  -s soainfra-rcu-credentials The parameter values are:\n -u username for schema owner (regular user), required. -p password for schema owner (regular user), required. -a username for SYSDBA user, required. -q password for SYSDBA user, required. -d domainUID. Example: soainfra -n namespace. Example: soans -s secretName. Example: soainfra-rcu-credentials  You can confirm the secret was created as expected with the kubectl get secret command.\nFor example:\n  Click here to see the sample secret description.   $ kubectl get secret soainfra-rcu-credentials -o yaml -n soans apiVersion: v1 data: password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ== sys_username: c3lz username: U09BMQ== kind: Secret metadata: creationTimestamp: \u0026#34;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026#34; labels: weblogic.domainName: soainfra weblogic.domainUID: soainfra managedFields: - apiVersion: v1 fieldsType: FieldsV1 fieldsV1: f:data: .: {} f:password: {} f:sys_password: {} f:sys_username: {} f:username: {} f:metadata: f:labels: .: {} f:weblogic.domainName: {} f:weblogic.domainUID: {} f:type: {} manager: kubectl operation: Update time: \u0026#34;2020-06-25T14:08:16Z\u0026#34; name: soainfra-rcu-credentials namespace: soans resourceVersion: \u0026#34;265386\u0026#34; selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-rcu-credentials uid: 2d93941c-656b-43a4-8af2-78ca8be0f293 type: Opaque    Configure access to your database Oracle SOA Suite domains require a database with the necessary schemas installed in them. The Repository Creation Utility (RCU) allows you to create those schemas. You must set up the database before you create your domain. There are no additional requirements added by running Oracle SOA Suite in Kubernetes; the same existing requirements apply.\nFor production deployments, you must set up and use the standalone (non-container) based database running outside of Kubernetes.\nBefore creating a domain, you will need to set up the necessary schemas in your database.\nRun the Repository Creation Utility to set up your database schemas Create schemas To create the database schemas for Oracle SOA Suite, run the create-rcu-schema.sh script.\nFor example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-schema $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh -h usage: ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s \u0026lt;schemaPrefix\u0026gt; -t \u0026lt;schemaType\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;dburl\u0026gt; -i \u0026lt;image\u0026gt; -u \u0026lt;imagePullPolicy\u0026gt; -p \u0026lt;docker-store\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; -q \u0026lt;sysPassword\u0026gt; -r \u0026lt;schemaPassword\u0026gt; -o \u0026lt;rcuOutputDir\u0026gt; -c \u0026lt;customVariables\u0026gt; [-l] \u0026lt;timeoutLimit\u0026gt; [-h] -s RCU Schema Prefix (required) -t RCU Schema Type (optional) (supported values: osb,soa,soaosb) -d RCU Oracle Database URL (optional) (default: oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s) -p OracleSOASuite ImagePullSecret (optional) (default: none) -i OracleSOASuite Image (optional) (default: soasuite:12.2.1.4) -u OracleSOASuite ImagePullPolicy (optional) (default: IfNotPresent) -n Namespace for RCU pod (optional) (default: default) -q password for database SYSDBA user.

You must specify one of these using the -t flag. For Oracle SOA Suite you must specify the Oracle SOA schema profile type using the -c flag. For example, -c SOA_PROFILE_TYPE=SMALL. Supported values for SOA_PROFILE_TYPE are SMALL, MED, and LARGE.   Note: To use the LARGE schema profile type, make sure that the partitioning feature is enabled in the Oracle Database.\n Make sure that you maintain the association between the database schemas and the matching domain just like you did in a non-Kubernetes environment. There is no specific functionality provided to help with this.\nDrop schemas If you want to drop a schema, you can use the drop-rcu-schema.sh script.\nFor example:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR}/create-rcu-schema $ ./drop-rcu-schema.sh -h usage: ./drop-rcu-schema.sh -s \u0026lt;schemaPrefix\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;dburl\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; -q \u0026lt;sysPassword\u0026gt; -r \u0026lt;schemaPassword\u0026gt; -c \u0026lt;customVariables\u0026gt; [-h] -s RCU Schema Prefix (required) -t RCU Schema Type (optional) (supported values: osb,soa,soaosb) -d Oracle Database URL (optional) (default: oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s) -n Namespace where RCU pod is deployed (optional) (default: default) -q password for database SYSDBA user.

	"content": "Learn how to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications using the Maven and Ant based approach in an Oracle SOA Suite in WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment.\nBefore deploying composite applications, we need to create a Kubernetes pod in the same cluster where the Oracle SOA Suite domain is running, so that composite applications can be deployed using the internal Kubernetes Service for the Administration Server URL.\nPlace the SOA/Oracle Service Bus composite project at a share location (for example at /share/soa-deploy) mounted at /composites inside container. Make sure to provide oracle user ( uid: 1000 and gid: 0) permission to directory /share/soa-deploy, so that it is accessible and writable inside the container.\n$ sudo chown -R 1000:0 /share/soa-deploy Follow the steps in this section to create a container and then use it to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications using Maven or Ant.\nCreate a composite deployment container Before creating a Kubernetes pod, make sure that the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image is available on a node, or you can create an image pull secret so that the pod can pull the Docker image on the host where it gets created.\n  Create an image pull secret to pull image soasuite:12.2.1.4 by the Kubernetes pod:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry image-secret -n soans --docker-server=your-registry.com --docker-username=xxxxxx --docker-password=xxxxxxx --docker-email=my@company.com   Create a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim (soadeploy-pv.yaml and soadeploy-pvc.yaml) with sample composites for build and deploy placed at /share/soa-deploy.\na) Create a PersistentVolume with the sample provided (soadeploy-pv.yaml), which uses NFS (you can use hostPath or any other supported PV type):\napiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: soadeploy-pv spec: storageClassName: soadeploy-storage-class capacity: storage: 10Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteMany # Valid values are Retain, Delete or Recycle persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain # hostPath: nfs: server: X.X.X.X path: \u0026quot;/share/soa-deploy\u0026quot; b) Apply the YAML:\n$ kubectl apply -f soadeploy-pv.yaml c) Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (soadeploy-pvc.yaml):\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: soadeploy-pvc namespace: soans spec: storageClassName: soadeploy-storage-class accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 10Gi d) Apply the YAML:\n$ kubectl apply -f soadeploy-pvc.yaml   Create a composite deploy pod using soadeploy.yaml to mount the composites inside pod at /composites:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: run: soadeploy name: soadeploy namespace: soans spec: imagePullSecrets: - name: image-secret containers: - image: soasuite:12.2.1.4 name: soadeploy env: - name: M2_HOME value: /u01/oracle/oracle_common/modules/org.apache.maven_3.2.5 command: [\u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; $HOME/.bashrc; sleep infinity\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - name: mycomposite mountPath: /composites volumes: - name: mycomposite persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soadeploy-pvc   Create the pod:\n$ kubectl apply -f soadeploy.yaml   Once the Kubernetes pod is deployed, exec into the pod to perform Maven/Ant based build and deploy:\n$ kubectl exec -it -n soans soadeploy -- bash   Maven based build and deploy  Note: Make sure to execute these commands inside the soadeploy pod.\n Set up proxy details for Maven to pull dependencies from the internet.\nIf your environment is not running behind a proxy, then skip this step. Otherwise, replace REPLACE-WITH-PROXY-HOST, REPLACE-WITH-PROXY-PORT and the value for nonProxyHosts attribute per your environment and create the settings.xml:\n$ mkdir $HOME/.m2 $ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; $HOME/.m2/settings.xml \u0026lt;settings\u0026gt; \u0026lt;proxies\u0026gt; \u0026lt;proxy\u0026gt; \u0026lt;active\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/active\u0026gt; \u0026lt;protocol\u0026gt;http\u0026lt;/protocol\u0026gt; \u0026lt;host\u0026gt;REPLACE-WITH-PROXY-HOST\u0026lt;/host\u0026gt; \u0026lt;port\u0026gt;REPLACE-WITH-PROXY-PORT\u0026lt;/port\u0026gt; \u0026lt;nonProxyHosts\u0026gt;soainfra-cluster-soa-cluster|soainfra-adminserver\u0026lt;/nonProxyHosts\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/proxy\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/proxies\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/settings\u0026gt; EOF For Oracle SOA Suite composite applications   Set up the environment for Maven:\n#Perform Maven Sync $ cd /u01/oracle/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/ $ mvn install:install-file \\ -DpomFile=oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.pom \\ -Dfile=oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.jar #install Maven plugin $ mvn help:describe \\ -Dplugin=com.oracle.maven:oracle-maven-sync \\ -Ddetail #push libraries into internal repository $ mvn com.oracle.maven:oracle-maven-sync:push \\ -DoracleHome=/u01/oracle \\ -DtestingOnly=false $ mvn archetype:crawl \\ -Dcatalog=$HOME/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml \\ -DarchetypeArtifactId=oracle-soa-application \\ -DarchetypeVersion=12.2.1-4-0   Build the SOA Archive (SAR) for your sample deployment available at /composites/mavenproject/my-soa-app:\n$ cd /composites/mavenproject/my-soa-app $ mvn package The SAR will be generated at /composites/mavenproject/my-soa-app/my-project/target/sca_my-project.jar.\n  Deploy into the Oracle SOA Suite instance.

If the Administration Server was configured to expose a T3 channel in your domain, then follow these steps to recreate the Kubernetes service (for T3 channel) with the new name -ext.\n Note: If these steps are not performed, then the domain restart using spec.serverStartPolicy, would fail to bring up the servers.\n   Get the existing Kubernetes service name for T3 channel from the domain namespace. For example, if the domainUID is soainfra, and the Administration Server name is adminserver, then the service would be:\nsoainfra-adminserver-external   Delete the existing Kubernetes service for T3 channel, so that operator 3.1.1 creates a new one:\n$ kubectl delete service \u0026lt;T3 channel service\u0026gt; --namespace \u0026lt;domain-namespace\u0026gt; For example, if the domainUID is soainfra, the Administration Server name is adminserver and domain namespace is soans, then the command would be:\n$ kubectl delete service soainfra-adminserver-external --namespace soans   Then the operator automatically creates a new Kubernetes service with -ext instead of -external:\nsoainfra-adminserver-ext   "

	"content": "Learn how to deploy Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus composite applications artifacts in a Kubernetes persistent volume or in an image to an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using a WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nThe deployment methods described in Deploy using JDeveloper and Deploy using Maven and Ant are manual processes. If you have the deployment artifacts (archives) already built, then you can package them either into a Kubernetes persistent volume or in an image and use this automated process to deploy the artifacts to an Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nPrepare to use the deploy artifacts script The sample scripts for deploying artifacts are available at ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/\nYou must edit deploy-artifacts-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details of your domain and artifacts. Refer to the configuration parameters below to understand the information that you must provide in this file.\nConfiguration parameters The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     adminPort Port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   domainUID Unique ID that is used to identify the domain. This ID cannot contain any characters that are not valid in a Kubernetes service name. soainfra   domainType Type of the domain. Mandatory input for Oracle SOA Suite domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type values: soa (deploys artifacts into an Oracle SOA Suite domain), osb (deploys artifacts into an Oracle Service Bus domain), or soaosb (deploys artifacts into both Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus domains). soa   soaClusterName Name of the SOA WebLogic Server cluster instance in the domain. By default, the cluster name is soa_cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. soa_cluster   image SOA Suite Docker image. The artifacts deployment process requires Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4. Refer to Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image for details on how to obtain or create the image. soasuite:12.2.1.4   imagePullPolicy Oracle SOA Suite Docker image pull policy. Valid values are IfNotPresent, Always, Never. IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. soainfra-domain-credentials   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which the domain was created. soans   artifactsSourceType The deploy artifacts source type. Set to PersistentVolume for deploy artifacts available in a persistent volume and Image for deploy artifacts available as an image. Image   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created that hosts the deployment artifacts. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-deploy-artifacts-pvc. soainfra-deploy-artifacts-pvc   artifactsImage Deploy artifacts image. Required if artifactsSourceType is Image. artifacts:12.2.1.4   artifactsImagePullPolicy Deploy artifacts image pull policy. Valid values are IfNotPresent, Always, Never. IfNotPresent   artifactsImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the deploy artifacts image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    deployScriptFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate the required files to deploy artifacts to the Oracle SOA Suite domain, including the script that is specified in the deployScriptName parameter. By default, this directory is set to the relative path deploy. deploy   deployScriptsMountPath Mount path where the deploy artifacts scripts are located inside a pod. The deploy-artifacts.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified by the deployScriptName parameter) in a Kubernetes pod to deploy the artifacts. Files in the deployScriptFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to deploy artifacts. /u01/weblogic   deployScriptName Script that the deploy artifacts script uses to deploy artifacts to the Oracle SOA Suite domain. For Oracle SOA Suite, the script placed in the soa directory is used. For Oracle Service Bus, the script placed in the osb directory is used. The deploy-artifacts.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to deploy artifacts. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified by the deployScriptsMountPath parameter. deploy.sh   soaArtifactsArchivePath Directory inside container where Oracle SOA Suite archives are placed. /u01/sarchives   osbArtifactsArchivePath Directory inside container where Oracle Service Bus archives are placed. /u01/sbarchives    The sample demonstrates how to deploy Oracle SOA Suite composites or Oracle Service Bus applications to an Oracle SOA Suite domain home.\nRun the deploy artifacts script Run the deploy artifacts script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ ./deploy-artifacts.sh \\ -i deploy-artifacts-inputs.yaml \\ -o \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; The script performs the following steps:\n Creates a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for the artifacts deployment process if it does not already exist. The path name is \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;YYYYMMDD-hhmmss\u0026gt;. If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before running this script. Creates a Kubernetes job that starts a utility Oracle SOA Suite container and run scripts to deploy artifacts provided either in an image or in a persistent volume.  Deploy artifacts from an image   Create an image with artifacts\na. A sample Dockerfile to create the artifacts in an image is available at $WORKDIR/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/deploy-docker-file. This expects the Oracle SOA Suite related archives to be available in the soa directory and Oracle Service Bus archives to be available in the osb directory.\nb. Create the soa directory and copy the Oracle SOA Suite archives to be deployed to the directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/deploy-docker-file $ mkdir soa $ cp /path/sca_sampleBPEL.jar soa c. Create the osb directory and copy the Oracle Service Bus archives to be deployed to the directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/deploy-docker-file $ mkdir osb $ cp /path/simple_sbconfig.jar osb d.

	"content": "The SOA deployment scripts demonstrate the creation of an Oracle SOA Suite domain home on an existing Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC). The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, complete the following steps:\n Review the Domain resource documentation. Review the requirements and limitations. Ensure that you have executed all the preliminary steps in Prepare your environment. Ensure that the database and the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator are running.  Prepare to use the create domain script The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at ${WORKDIR}/create-soa-domain.\nYou must edit create-domain-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain. Refer to the configuration parameters below to understand the information that you must provide in this file.\nConfiguration parameters The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     sslEnabled Boolean value indicating whether to enable SSL for each WebLogic Server instance. false   adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminServerSSLPort SSL port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7002   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   soaClusterName Name of the SOA WebLogic Server cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default, the cluster name is soa_cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. soa_cluster   osbClusterName Name of the Oracle Service Bus WebLogic Server cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default, the cluster name is osb_cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. osb_cluster   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic Server domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName parameter. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic Server domain. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified by the createDomainScriptName parameter) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic Server domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified by the createDomainScriptsMountPath parameter. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-in scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the SOA domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/soainfra   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic Server domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. soainfra   domainType Type of the domain. Mandatory input for Oracle SOA Suite domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type values: soa (deploys a SOA domain with Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)), osb (deploys an Oracle Service Bus domain), and soaosb (deploys a domain with SOA, Oracle Service Bus, and Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)). soa   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean value indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean value indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. false   httpAccessLogInLogHome Boolean value indicating if server HTTP access log files should be written to the same directory as logHome. If false, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory specified in the WebLogic Server domain home configuration. true   image SOA Suite Docker image. The operator requires Oracle SOA Suite 12.2.1.4. Refer to Obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image for details on how to obtain or create the image. soasuite:12.2.1.4   imagePullPolicy Oracle SOA Suite Docker image pull policy. Valid values are IfNotPresent, Always, Never. IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean value indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following predefined variables to obtain WebLogic Server domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). If sslEnabled is set to true and the WebLogic Server demo certificate is used, add -Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true to allow the Managed Servers to connect to the Administration Server while booting up. The WebLogic Server generated demo certificate in this environment typically contains a host name that is different from the runtime container\u0026rsquo;s host name. -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/soainfra   soaManagedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names in the SOA cluster. The default value is soa_server. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. soa_server   osbManagedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names in the Oracle Service Bus cluster. The default value is osb_server. This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. osb_server   soaManagedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server in the SOA cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. 8001   osbManagedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server in the Oracle Service Bus cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. 9001   soaManagedServerSSLPort SSL port number for each Managed Server in the SOA cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for soa and soaosb domain types. 8002   osbManagedServerSSLPort SSL port number for each Managed Server in the Oracle Service Bus cluster. This configuration parameter is applicable only for osb and soaosb domain types. 9002   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. soans   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. soainfra-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean value indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Valid values are NEVER, IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY. IF_NEEDED   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster.   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. soainfra-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database. For example SOA1. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. SOA1   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. soainfra-rcu-credentials   persistentStore The persistent store for \u0026lsquo;JMS servers\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Transaction log store\u0026rsquo; in the domain. Valid values are jdbc, file. jdbc    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, soaClusterName, and soaManagedServerNameBase etc. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an Oracle SOA Suite domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for the domain. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ ./create-domain.sh \\ -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \\ -o \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; The script will perform the following steps:\n  Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist. The path name is \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before using this script.\n  Create a Kubernetes job that will start up a utility Oracle SOA Suite container and run offline WLST scripts to create the domain on the shared storage.\n  Run and wait for the job to finish.\n  Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, domain.yaml, in the \u0026ldquo;output\u0026rdquo; directory that was created above. This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the kubectl create -f or kubectl apply -f command:\n$ kubectl apply -f \u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/domain.yaml   Create a convenient utility script, delete-domain-job.yaml, to clean up the domain home created by the create script.\n  The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001. A configured cluster named soa_cluster of size 5. Two Managed Servers, named soa_server1 and soa_server2, listening on port 8001. Log files that are located in /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. SOA Infra, SOA Composer, and WorklistApp applications deployed.  Refer to the troubleshooting page to troubleshoot issues during the domain creation.\n Verify the results The create domain script verifies that the domain was created, and reports failure if there is an error. However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.\nGenerated YAML files with the default inputs   Click here to see sample content of the generated `domain.yaml` for `soaosb` domainType that creates SOA and Oracle Service Bus clusters.   $ cat output/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml # Copyright (c) 2020, 2021, Oracle and/or its affiliates. # Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl. # # This is an example of how to define a Domain resource. # apiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v8\u0026quot;

You can:\n Create OIG instances in a Kubernetes persistent volume. This persistent volume can reside in an NFS file system or other Kubernetes volume types. Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states. Expose the OIG Services for external access. Scale OIG domains by starting and stopping Managed Servers on demand. Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana. Monitor the OIG instance using Prometheus and Grafana.

	"content": "Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides a secured communication for data sent over unsecured networks. In an SSL termination scenario, you can configure SSL between the client browser and the load balancer in your Oracle SOA Suite instance to ensure that applications are accessed securely. In an SSL end-to-end scenario, an Oracle SOA Suite domain is configured to use a self-signed SSL certificate that was generated during domain creation. Clients will typically receive a message indicating that the signing CA for the certificate is unknown and not trusted.\nThis section provides details on how to create and configure custom (CA-issued) SSL certificates for Oracle SOA Suite domains in both SSL end-to-end and SSL termination scenarios.\n Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL end-to-end scenario Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL termination at a load balancer  Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL end-to-end scenario These steps describe how to replace the identity and trust keystore of an Oracle SOA Suite domain with a custom identity and custom trust keystore and register with digital certificates procured from any third party authority.\nIn this documentation, the registered domain is mydomain.com and the CA signed certificates are taken from mydomain.\nCreate a custom identity and custom trust keystore and generate a certificate signing request (CSR) To create a custom identity and custom trust keystore and generate a CSR:\n  Log in to the Enterprise Manager (EM) Console and access the Keystores page by opening WebLogic Domain \u0026gt; Security \u0026gt; Keystore.\n  Under the system stripe, click Create Keystore to create a new keystore.\n  Provide the following details for custom identity:\nKeystore Name: custIdentity Protection: Select the Password option. Keystore Password: Enter the password. Confirm Password: Confirm the password.\n  Click Create Keystore to create another new keystore.\n  Provide the following details for custom trust:\n Keystore Name: custTrust Protection: Select the Password option. Keystore Password: Enter the password. Confirm Password: Confirm the password.    Click Manage on the custIdentity keystore name and provide the password that you specified previously.\n  Click Generate Keypair to create a new key pair, and provide the following details for custIdentity with alias as custIdentity and password:\n Alias Name: custIdentity Common Name: Common name, for example, soak8s.mydomain.com (Registered domain name) Organizational Unit: Name of the organizational unit Organization: Organization name Enter City, State, and Country names Key Type: RSA Key Size: 2048 Password: Enter the password    Click OK to generate the keypair.\n  Select the newly created keypair and click Generate CSR.\n  Export the created CSR, share it with Certificate Authority, such as digicert CA, and get root, intermediate, and signed certificates. The certificate is generated for the domain name you used in the Common Name field.\n  It is not mandatory to create identity and trust keystore under the system stripe that comes with default provisioning. You can create a new custom stripe and create identity and trust keystores under it.\nShare the CSR with CA to get CA-signed certificates   Select the new keypair under the custIdentity and click Generate CSR.\n  Export the created CSR and share it with the Certificate Authority and get root, intermediate, and signed certificates. The certificate is generated for the domain name you used in the Common Name field.\n  Download the certificates shared in the zip file from the CA. The zip file contains one of the following:\n the three certificates individually - root, intermediate, and signed certificates root and intermediate certificates in one chain and signed certificate separately    Double-click the certificate chain for root and intermediate certificates. You can see the full chain when you click on the certification path.\n  Extract the root and intermediate certificates individually by going to the certification path, select the certificate to be extracted (root or intermediate) and click View Certificate.\n  On the View Certificates pop-up, select the Details tab and click Copy to File.\n  In the Certificate Export wizard, click Next, then select Base 64 encoded X.509 (CER), and then click Next. Export the certificate.\n  Name the exported certificate as root and intermediate certificates respectively.\n  Import CA certificates Certificate Authority (CA) certificates must be imported in the following order: first the signed server certificate, then the intermediate certificate, and then the root certificate.\nTo import CA certificates:\n  Use WLST commands to import the certificate chain in the identity keystore (custIdentity):\na. Combine the three certificates into a single text file called chain.pem in the following order: signed server certificate, followed by intermediate certificate, followed by root certificate:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;signed server certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;intermediate certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u0026lt;root certificate\u0026gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- b. Place the chain.pem in /tmp from where you will be executing the kubectl commands (for example, on the master node).\nc. Enter the following command to change the file ownership to 1000:1000 user/group:\n$ sudo chown 1000:1000 /tmp/chain.pem d. Copy /tmp/chain.pem into the Administration Server pod (for example, soainfra-adminserver):\n$ kubectl cp /tmp/chain.pem soans/soainfra-adminserver:/tmp/chain.pem e. Exec into the Administration Server pod to perform all operations:\n$ kubectl exec -it soainfra-adminserver -n soans -- bash f. Start WLST and access the Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) key store service:\n$ cd /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/ $ ./wlst.sh : : wls:/offline\u0026gt; connect(\u0026quot;weblogic\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Welcome1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;t3://soainfra-adminserver:7001\u0026quot;) : : wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc = getOpssService(name='KeyStoreService') g.

Exit WLST:\nexit()   Use Oracle Enterprise Manager to import the certificate chain into the trust keystore (custTrust):\na. Log in to the Enterprise Manager Console and access the Keystores page by opening WebLogic domain \u0026gt; Security \u0026gt; Keystore.\nb. Select the trust keystore (custTrust) and click Manage.\nc. Click Import Certificate and import the certificates in this order:\n  the signed server certificate as a trusted certificate (alias mySignedCert)\n  the intermediate certificate from CA as a trusted certificate (alias myInterCA)\n  the root certificate from CA as a trusted certificate (alias myRootCA)\n    Synchronize the local keystore with the security store Synchronize keystores to synchronize information between the domain home and the Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) store in the database.\nTo synchronize keystores:\n Exec into the Administration server pod (for example, soainfra-adminserver): $ kubectl exec -it soainfra-adminserver -n soans -- bash  Start WLST and access the Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) keystore service: $ cd /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/ $ ./wlst.sh : : wls:/offline\u0026gt; connect(\u0026quot;weblogic\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Welcome1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;t3://soainfra-adminserver:7001\u0026quot;) : : wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc = getOpssService(name='KeyStoreService')  Enter the following commands to synchronize the custom identity and custom trust keystores:  Note: This step is necessary only if you are using the system stripe. You do not need to synchronize the keystores if you are using a custom stripe.\n wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.listKeyStoreAliases(appStripe=\u0026quot;system\u0026quot;, name=\u0026quot;custIdentity\u0026quot;, password=\u0026quot; ****\u0026quot;, type=\u0026quot;*\u0026quot;) wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; syncKeyStores(appStripe='system',keystoreFormat='KSS') wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.listKeyStoreAliases (appStripe=\u0026quot;system\u0026quot;, name=\u0026quot;myKSSTrust\u0026quot;, password=\u0026quot;****\u0026quot;, type=\u0026quot;*\u0026quot;) wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; syncKeyStores(appStripe='system',keystoreFormat='KSS')   Update the WebLogic keystores with custom identity and trust To update the WebLogic keystores with custom identity and custom trust:\n  In the WebLogic Server Administration Console, open Servers \u0026gt; AdminServer \u0026gt; Configurations \u0026gt; Keystores tab.\n  Change the Keystores to Custom Identity and Custom Trust and Save.\n  Provide the values for Custom Identity:\n Custom Identity Keystore: kss://system/custidentity Custom Identity KeyStore Type: KSS Custom Identity PassPhrase: enter password given while creating the custIdentity keystore. Confirm Custom Identity PassPhrase: reenter the password.    Provide the values for Custom Trust:\n Custom Trust Keystore: kss://system/custTrust Custom Trust KeyStore Type: KSS Custom Trust PassPhrase: enter password given while creating the custTrust keystore. Confirm Custom Trust PassPhrase: reenter the password.    Click Save and then Activate changes.\n  Open the SSL tab and provide the following details:\n Private Key Alias: custIdentity (this is the alias given while creating the key pair in the custIdentity keystore.) Private Key PassPhrase: enter password given while creating the key pair under the custIdentity keystore. Confirm Private Key PassPhrase: reenter the password.    In the Advanced section, change Hostname Verification to None. Click Save and Activate changes.\n  Repeat steps 1 to 7 for all Managed Servers.\n  Restart the domain.\n  Once the servers are up and running, you can check if the SSL URLs show the updated certificates.\n  For more details, refer to:\n Administering Oracle SOA Cloud Service Administering Oracle Fusion Middleware  Create custom SSL certificates in an SSL termination at a load balancer This section provides references to configure a custom SSL certificate at a load balancer.\nThere are multiple CA vendors in the marketplace today, each offering different levels of service at varying price points. Research and choose a CA vendor that meets your service-level and budget requirements.\nFor a CA vendor to issue you a CA-issued SSL certificate, you must provide the following information:\n Your custom domain name. Public information associated with the domain confirming you as the owner. Email address associated with the custom domain for verification.  Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for your load balancer and submit the CSR to the CA vendor. After receiving the CA-issued certificate, refer to Administering Oracle SOA Cloud Service to import the CA-issued SSL certificate to the load balancer. If you are using openssl to create the certificates, you can refer to Manually Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Using OpenSSL to submit the CSR to the CA vendor.\n"

Alternatively you can place the image in a Docker registry that your cluster can access.\n After installing the OAM Docker image run the following command to make sure the image is installed correctly on the master and worker nodes:\n$ docker images The output will look similar to the following:\nREPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE oracle/oam 12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-210721.0755 720a172374e6 2 weeks ago 3.38GB quay.io/coreos/flannel v0.15.0 09b38f011a29 6 days ago 69.5MB rancher/mirrored-flannelcni-flannel-cni-plugin v1.2 98660e6e4c3a 13 days ago 8.98MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy v1.20.10 945c9bce487a 2 months ago 99.7MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager v1.20.10 2f450864515d 2 months ago 116MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver v1.20.10 644cadd07add 2 months ago 122MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler v1.20.10 4c9be8dc650b 2 months ago 47.3MB k8s.gcr.io/etcd 3.4.13-0 0369cf4303ff 14 months ago 253MB k8s.gcr.io/coredns 1.7.0 bfe3a36ebd25 16 months ago 45.2MB k8s.gcr.io/pause 3.2 80d28bedfe5d 20 months ago 683kB Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Docker image The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Docker image must be installed on the master node and each of the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can place the image in a Docker registry that your cluster can access.\n   Pull the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator image by running the following command on the master node:\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 The output will look similar to the following:\nTrying to pull repository ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator ... 3.3.0: Pulling from ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator c828c776e142: Pull complete 175676c54fa1: Pull complete b3231f480c32: Pull complete ea4423fa8daa: Pull complete f3ca38f7f95f: Pull complete effd851583ec: Pull complete 4f4fb700ef54: Pull complete Digest: sha256:3e93848ad2f5b272c88680e7b37a4ee428dd12e4c4c91af6977fd2fa9ec1f9dc Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0   Run the docker tag command as follows:\n$ docker tag ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 After installing the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator image, repeat the above on the worker nodes.\n  Set up the code repository to deploy OAM domains OAM domain deployment on Kubernetes leverages the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator infrastructure. For deploying the OAM domains, you need to set up the deployment scripts on the master node as below:\n  Create a working directory to setup the source code.\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/OAMK8S   Download the latest OAM deployment scripts from the OAM repository.\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/21.4.2 For example:\n$ cd /scratch/OAMK8S $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/21.4.2   Set the $WORKDIR environment variable as follows:\n$ export WORKDIR=\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleAccessManagement For example:\n$ export WORKDIR=/scratch/OAMK8S/fmw-kubernetes/OracleAccessManagement   Run the following command and see if the WebLogic custom resource definition name already exists:\n$ kubectl get crd In the output you should see:\nNo resources found If you see the following:\nNAME AGE domains.weblogic.oracle 5d then run the following command to delete the existing crd:\n$ kubectl delete crd domains.weblogic.oracle customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io \u0026#34;domains.weblogic.oracle\u0026#34; deleted   Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator   On the master node run the following command to create a namespace for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/opns created   Create a service account for the operator in the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace by running the following command:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-sa\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/op-sa created   If you want to to setup logging and visualisation with Elasticsearch and Kibana (post domain creation) edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator/values.yaml and set the parameter elkIntegrationEnabled to true and make sure the following parameters are set:\n# elkIntegrationEnabled specifies whether or not ELK integration is enabled. elkIntegrationEnabled: true # logStashImage specifies the docker image containing logstash. # This parameter is ignored if 'elkIntegrationEnabled' is false. logStashImage: \u0026quot;logstash:6.6.0\u0026quot; # elasticSearchHost specifies the hostname of where elasticsearch is running. # This parameter is ignored if 'elkIntegrationEnabled' is false. elasticSearchHost: \u0026quot;elasticsearch.default.svc.cluster.local\u0026quot; # elasticSearchPort specifies the port number of where elasticsearch is running. # This parameter is ignored if 'elkIntegrationEnabled' is false. elasticSearchPort: 9200 After the domain creation see Logging and Visualization in order to complete the setup of Elasticsearch and Kibana.\n  Run the following helm command to install and start the operator:\n$ cd $WORKDIR $ helm install weblogic-kubernetes-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt;

A Kubernetes persistent volume is an arbitrary name (determined in this case, by Oracle) that is mapped to a physical volume on a disk.\nWhen a container is started, it needs to mount that volume. The physical volume should be on a shared disk accessible by all the Kubernetes worker nodes because it is not known on which worker node the container will be started. In the case of Identity and Access Management, the persistent volume does not get erased when a container stops. This enables persistent configurations.\nThe example below uses an NFS mounted volume (/accessdomainpv). Other volume types can also be used. See the official Kubernetes documentation for Volumes.\nTo create a Kubernetes persistent volume, perform the following steps:\n  Make a backup copy of the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and create required directories:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p /\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv $ chmod -R 777 /\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc $ cp create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml.orig $ mkdir output $ mkdir -p /scratch/OAMK8S/accessdomainpv $ chmod -R 777 /scratch/OAMK8S/accessdomainpv Note: The persistent volume directory needs to be accessible to both the master and worker node(s) via NFS. Make sure this path has full access permissions, and that the folder is empty. In this example /scratch/OAMK8S/accessdomainpv is accessible from all nodes via NFS.\n  On the master node run the following command to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt For example:\ncd /scratch/OAMK8S/accessdomainpv touch filemaster.txt ls filemaster.txt On the first worker node run the following to ensure it is possible to read and write to the persistent volume:\ncd /scratch/OAMK8S/accessdomainpv ls filemaster.txt touch fileworker1.txt ls fileworker1.txt Repeat the above for any other worker nodes e.g fileworker2.txt etc. Once proven that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to read and write from each node to the persistent volume, delete the files created.\n  Edit the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file and update the following parameters to reflect your settings. Save the file when complete:\nbaseName: \u0026lt;domain\u0026gt; domainUID: \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; namespace: \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; weblogicDomainStorageType: NFS weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer: \u0026lt;nfs_server\u0026gt;

Create a Kubernetes persistent volume and persistent volume claim\n  Set up your Kubernetes cluster If you need help setting up a Kubernetes environment, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation to set up a production grade Kubernetes cluster.\nIt is recommended you have a master node and one or more worker nodes. The examples in this documentation assume one master and two worker nodes.\nVerify that the system clocks on each host computer are synchronized. You can do this by running the date command simultaneously on all the hosts in each cluster.\nAfter creating Kubernetes clusters, you can optionally:\n Configure an Ingress to direct traffic to backend domains. Configure Kibana and Elasticsearch for your operator logs.  Install Helm As per the prerequisites an installation of Helm is required to create and deploy the necessary resources and then run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. For Helm installation and usage information, refer to the README.\nCheck the Kubernetes cluster is ready   Run the following command on the master node to check the cluster and worker nodes are running:\n$ kubectl get nodes,pods -n kube-system The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION node/worker-node1 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 17h v1.20.10 node/worker-node2 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 17h v1.20.10 node/master-node Ready master 23h v1.20.10 NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/coredns-66bff467f8-fnhbq 1/1 Running 0 23h pod/coredns-66bff467f8-xtc8k 1/1 Running 0 23h pod/etcd-master 1/1 Running 0 21h pod/kube-apiserver-master-node 1/1 Running 0 21h pod/kube-controller-manager-master-node 1/1 Running 0 21h pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-lxsfw 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-pqrqr 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-flannel-ds-amd64-wj5nh 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-proxy-2kxv2 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-proxy-82vvj 1/1 Running 0 17h pod/kube-proxy-nrgw9 1/1 Running 0 23h pod/kube-scheduler-master 1/1 Running 0 21$   Install the OIG Docker Image You can deploy OIG Docker images in the following ways:\n  Download a prebuilt OIG Docker image from My Oracle Support by referring to the document ID 2723908.1. This image is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle Identity Governance 12.2.1.4.0 and the latest PSU.\n  Build your own OIG image using the WebLogic Image Tool or by using the dockerfile, scripts and base images from Oracle Container Registry (OCR). You can also build your own image by using only the dockerfile and scripts. For more information about the various ways in which you can build your own container image, see Building the OIG Docker Image.\n  Choose one of these options based on your requirements.\nThe OIG Docker image must be installed on the master node and each of the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can place the image in a Docker registry that your cluster can access.\n After installing the OIG Docker image run the following command to make sure the image is installed correctly on the master and worker nodes:\n$ docker images The output will look similar to the following:\nREPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE oracle/oig 12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-211022.0723 f05f3b63c9e8 2 weeks ago 4.43GB quay.io/coreos/flannel v0.15.0 09b38f011a29 6 days ago 69.5MB rancher/mirrored-flannelcni-flannel-cni-plugin v1.2 98660e6e4c3a 13 days ago 8.98MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy v1.20.10 945c9bce487a 2 months ago 99.7MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager v1.20.10 2f450864515d 2 months ago 116MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver v1.20.10 644cadd07add 2 months ago 122MB k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler v1.20.10 4c9be8dc650b 2 months ago 47.3MB k8s.gcr.io/etcd 3.4.13-0 0369cf4303ff 14 months ago 253MB k8s.gcr.io/coredns 1.7.0 bfe3a36ebd25 16 months ago 45.2MB k8s.gcr.io/pause 3.2 80d28bedfe5d 20 months ago Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Docker Image The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Docker image must be installed on the master node and each of the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can place the image in a Docker registry that your cluster can access.\n   Pull the Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator image by running the following command on the master node:\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 The output will look similar to the following:\nTrying to pull repository ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator ... 3.3.0: Pulling from ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator c828c776e142: Pull complete 175676c54fa1: Pull complete b3231f480c32: Pull complete ea4423fa8daa: Pull complete f3ca38f7f95f: Pull complete effd851583ec: Pull complete 4f4fb700ef54: Pull complete Digest: sha256:3e93848ad2f5b272c88680e7b37a4ee428dd12e4c4c91af6977fd2fa9ec1f9dc Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0   Run the docker tag command as follows:\n$ docker tag ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 After installing the Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Operator image, repeat the above on the worker nodes.\n  Setup the Code Repository to Deploy OIG Domains Oracle Identity Governance domain deployment on Kubernetes leverages the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator infrastructure. For deploying the OIG domains, you need to set up the deployment scripts on the master node as below:\n  Create a working directory to setup the source code.\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/OIGK8S   Download the latest OIG deployment scripts from the OIG repository.\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/21.4.2 For example:\n$ cd /scratch/OIGK8S $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git --branch release/21.4.2   Set the $WORKDIR environment variable as follows:\n$ export WORKDIR=\u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance For example:\n$ export WORKDIR=/scratch/OIGK8S/fmw-kubernetes/OracleIdentityGovernance   Run the following command and see if the WebLogic custom resource definition name already exists:\n$ kubectl get crd In the output you should see:\nNo resources found in default namespace. If you see the following:\nNAME AGE domains.weblogic.oracle 5d then run the following command to delete the existing crd:\n$ kubectl delete crd domains.weblogic.oracle customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io \u0026#34;domains.weblogic.oracle\u0026#34; deleted   Install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator   On the master node run the following command to create a namespace for the operator:\n$ kubectl create namespace \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create namespace opns The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/opns created   Create a service account for the operator in the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace by running the following command:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-ns\u0026gt; \u0026lt;sample-kubernetes-operator-sa\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount -n opns op-sa The output will look similar to the following:\nserviceaccount/op-sa created   If you want to setup logging and visualisation with Elasticsearch and Kibana (post domain creation) edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator/values.yaml and set the parameter elkIntegrationEnabled to true and make sure the following parameters are set:\n# elkIntegrationEnabled specifies whether or not ELK integration is enabled. elkIntegrationEnabled: true # logStashImage specifies the docker image containing logstash. # This parameter is ignored if 'elkIntegrationEnabled' is false. logStashImage: \u0026quot;logstash:6.6.0\u0026quot;

For publishing operator logs, see this sample.\nPrerequisites If you have not already set up Elasticsearch and Kibana for logs collection, refer this document and complete the setup.\nPublish to Elasticsearch The Diagnostics or other logs can be pushed to Elasticsearch server using logstash pod. The logstash pod should have access to the shared domain home or the log location. In case of the Oracle SOA Suite domain, the persistent volume of the domain home can be used in the logstash pod. The steps to create the logstash pod are,\n  Get Domain home persistence volume claim details of the domain home of the Oracle SOA Suite domain. The following command will list the persistent volume claim details in the namespace - soans. In the example below the persistent volume claim is soainfra-domain-pvc:\n$ kubectl get pvc -n soans Sample output:\nNAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE soainfra-domain-pvc Bound soainfra-domain-pv 10Gi RWX soainfra-domain-storage-class xxd   Create logstash configuration file (logstash.conf). Below is a sample logstash configuration to push diagnostic logs of all servers available at DOMAIN_HOME/servers/\u0026lt;server_name\u0026gt;/logs/-diagnostic.log:\ninput { file { path =\u0026gt; \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/soainfra/servers/**/logs/*-diagnostic.log\u0026quot; start_position =\u0026gt; beginning } } filter { grok { match =\u0026gt; [ \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt;%{DATA:log_timestamp}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{WORD:log_level}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{WORD:thread}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{HOSTNAME:hostname}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{HOSTNAME:servername}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:timer}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;%{DATA:kernel}\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:uuid}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{NUMBER:timestamp}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:misc}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:log_number}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%{DATA:log_message}\u0026gt;\u0026quot; ] } } output { elasticsearch { hosts =\u0026gt; [\u0026quot;elasticsearch.default.svc.cluster.local:9200\u0026quot;] } }   Copy the logstash.conf into say /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains so that it can be used for logstash deployment, using Administration Server pod ( For example soainfra-adminserver pod in namespace soans):\n$ kubectl cp logstash.conf soans/soainfra-adminserver:/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains --namespace soans   Create deployment YAML (logstash.yaml) for logstash pod using the domain home persistence volume claim. Make sure to point the logstash configuration file to correct location ( For example: we copied logstash.conf to /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logstash.conf) and also correct domain home persistence volume claim. Below is a sample logstash deployment YAML:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: logstash-soa namespace: soans spec: selector: matchLabels: app: logstash-soa template: # create pods using pod definition in this template metadata: labels: app: logstash-soa spec: volumes: - name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: soainfra-domain-pvc - name: shared-logs emptyDir: {} containers: - name: logstash image: logstash:6.6.0 command: [\u0026quot;/bin/sh\u0026quot;] args: [\u0026quot;/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logstash.conf\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects name: soainfra-domain-storage-volume - name: shared-logs mountPath: /shared-logs ports: - containerPort: 5044 name: logstash   Deploy logstash to start publish logs to Elasticsearch:\n$ kubectl create -f logstash.yaml   Now, you can view the diagnostics logs using Kibana with index pattern \u0026ldquo;logstash-*\u0026rdquo;.\n  "

A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/accessinfra   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. oam_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. accessns   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. accessinfra-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are NEVER, IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY. IF_NEEDED   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. accessinfra-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example OAM1. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. OAM1   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. accessinfra-rcu-credentials    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an OAM domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script   Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\ncd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o /\u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output The output will look similar to the following:\nInput parameters being used export version=\u0026quot;create-weblogic-sample-domain-inputs-v1\u0026quot; export adminPort=\u0026quot;7001\u0026quot; export adminServerName=\u0026quot;AdminServer\u0026quot; export domainUID=\u0026quot;accessdomain\u0026quot; export domainType=\u0026quot;oam\u0026quot; export domainHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/accessdomain\u0026quot; export serverStartPolicy=\u0026quot;IF_NEEDED\u0026quot; export clusterName=\u0026quot;oam_cluster\u0026quot; export configuredManagedServerCount=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; export initialManagedServerReplicas=\u0026quot;2\u0026quot; export managedServerNameBase=\u0026quot;oam_server\u0026quot; export managedServerPort=\u0026quot;14100\u0026quot; export image=\u0026quot;oracle/oam:12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-210721.0755\u0026quot; export imagePullPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; export productionModeEnabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export weblogicCredentialsSecretName=\u0026quot;accessdomain-credentials\u0026quot; export includeServerOutInPodLog=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export logHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/accessdomain\u0026quot; export httpAccessLogInLogHome=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export t3ChannelPort=\u0026quot;30012\u0026quot; export exposeAdminT3Channel=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export adminNodePort=\u0026quot;30701\u0026quot; export exposeAdminNodePort=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export namespace=\u0026quot;oamns\u0026quot; javaOptions=-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false export persistentVolumeClaimName=\u0026quot;accessdomain-domain-pvc\u0026quot; export domainPVMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptsMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/weblogic\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptName=\u0026quot;create-domain-job.sh\u0026quot; export createDomainFilesDir=\u0026quot;wlst\u0026quot; export rcuSchemaPrefix=\u0026quot;OAMK8S\u0026quot; export rcuDatabaseURL=\u0026quot;mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com\u0026quot; export rcuCredentialsSecret=\u0026quot;accessdomain-rcu-credentials\u0026quot; createFiles - valuesInputFile is create-domain-inputs.yaml createDomainScriptName is create-domain-job.sh Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/create-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/delete-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain/domain.yaml Checking to see if the secret accessdomain-credentials exists in namespace oamns configmap/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm created Checking the configmap accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm was created configmap/accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-cm labeled Checking if object type job with name accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job exists No resources found in oamns namespace.

The minimum recommended values are -Xms4096m -Xmx8192m. However, Oracle recommends you to set these to -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m in a production environment.\n  Navigate to the /output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; directory:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-access-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/accessdomain   Edit the domain.yaml file and locate the section of the file starting with: - clusterName: oam_cluster.

This parameter specifies the number of managed servers to be started in sequence per cluster. For example if you updated the initialManagedServerReplicas to 4 in create-domain-inputs.yaml and only had 2 nodes, then setting maxClusterConcurrentStartup: 1 will start one managed server at a time on each node, rather than starting them all at once. This can be useful to take the strain off individual nodes at startup.

When a pod has a STATUS of 0/1 the pod is started but the OAM server associated with it is currently starting. While the pods are starting you can check the startup status in the pod logs, by running the following command:\n$ kubectl logs accessdomain-adminserver -n oamns $ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 -n oamns $ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-server1 -n oamns etc.. The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named AdminServer listening on port 7001. A configured OAM cluster named oam_cluster of size 5. A configured Policy Manager cluster named policy_cluster of size 5. Two started OAM managed Servers, named oam_server1 and oam_server2, listening on port 14100.

Create Docker registry secret This section should only be followed if you are using a registry to store your container images and have not downloaded the container image to the master and worker nodes.\n  Create a Docker Registry Secret with name oig-docker:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry oig-docker -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --docker-username=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;user_name\u0026gt;\u0026#39; --docker-password=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#39; --docker-server=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;docker_registry_url\u0026gt;\u0026#39; --docker-email=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;email_address\u0026gt;\u0026#39; For example:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry oig-docker -n oigns --docker-username=\u0026#39;user1\u0026#39; --docker-password=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#39; --docker-server=\u0026#39;https://registry.example.com\u0026#39; --docker-email=\u0026#39;user1@example.com\u0026#39; The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/oig-docker created   Prepare the create domain script The sample scripts for Oracle Identity Governance domain deployment are available at $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain.\n  Make a copy of the create-domain-inputs.yaml file:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ cp create-domain-inputs.yaml create-domain-inputs.yaml.orig You must edit create-domain-inputs.yaml (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain. Please refer to the configuration parameters below to understand the information that you must provide in this file.\n  Edit configuration parameters   Edit the create-domain-inputs.yaml and modify the following parameters. Save the file when complete:\ndomainUID: \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; image: \u0026lt;image_name\u0026gt; imagePullSecretName: \u0026lt;docker-secret\u0026gt; weblogicCredentialsSecretName: \u0026lt;kubernetes_domain_secret\u0026gt; logHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/\u0026lt;domain_id\u0026gt; namespace: \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; persistentVolumeClaimName: \u0026lt;pvc_name\u0026gt; rcuSchemaPrefix: \u0026lt;rcu_prefix\u0026gt; rcuDatabaseURL: \u0026lt;rcu_db_host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;rcu_db_port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;rcu_db_service_name\u0026gt; rcuCredentialsSecret: \u0026lt;kubernetes_rcu_secret\u0026gt; frontEndHost: \u0026lt;front_end_hostname\u0026gt; frontEndPort: \u0026lt;front_end_port\u0026gt; For example:\ndomainUID: governancedomain domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/governancedomain image: oracle/oig:12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-211022.0723 imagePullSecretName: oig-docker weblogicCredentialsSecretName: oig-domain-credentials logHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/governancedomain namespace: oigns persistentVolumeClaimName: governancedomain-domain-pvc rcuSchemaPrefix: OIGK8S rcuDatabaseURL: mydatabasehost.example.com:1521/orcl.example.com rcuCredentialsSecret: oig-rcu-credentials frontEndHost: masternode.example.com frontEndPort: 14100 Note: frontEndHost and front_end_port should be set to the entry point host and port for OIM. This can be changed later in Set OIMFrontendURL using MBeans.\nNote: If using a container registry for your container images then you need to set image to the repository image name and imagePullSecretName to the name of the secret created earlier e.g: oig-docker. If not using a docker registry to pull docker images, comment out imagePullSecretName: \u0026lt;docker-secret\u0026gt;.\n  A full list of parameters in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file are shown below:\n   Parameter Definition Default     adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. AdminServer   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is oimcluster for the OIG domain. oimcluster   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path wdt, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the OIG domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/oimcluster   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. /u01/oracle/user_projects   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. oimcluster   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. true   image OIG Docker image. The operator requires OIG 12.2.1.4. Refer to OIG domains for details on how to obtain or create the image. oracle/oig:12.2.1.4.0   imagePullPolicy WebLogic Docker image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include the server .out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHome The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/oimcluster   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. oim_server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. oimcluster   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. oimcluster-domain-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are NEVER, IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY. IF_NEEDED   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. oimcluster-domain-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image.    serverPodCpuRequest, serverPodMemoryRequest, serverPodCpuCLimit, serverPodMemoryLimit The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Managing Compute Resources for Containers for details. Resource requests and resource limits are not specified.   rcuSchemaPrefix The schema prefix to use in the database, for example OIGK8S. You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. OIGK8S   rcuDatabaseURL The database URL. oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s   rcuCredentialsSecret The Kubernetes secret containing the database credentials. oimcluster-rcu-credentials   frontEndHost The entry point URL for the OIM. Not set   frontEndPort The entry point port for the OIM. Not set    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create an OIG domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nRun the create domain script Generate the create domain script   Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the generated artifacts:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ mkdir output $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o /\u0026lt;path to output-directory\u0026gt; For example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/create-oim-domain/domain-home-on-pv $ mkdir output $ ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml -o output The output will look similar to the following:\nInput parameters being used export version=\u0026quot;create-weblogic-sample-domain-inputs-v1\u0026quot; export adminPort=\u0026quot;7001\u0026quot; export adminServerName=\u0026quot;AdminServer\u0026quot; export domainUID=\u0026quot;governancedomain\u0026quot; export domainHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/governancedomain\u0026quot; export serverStartPolicy=\u0026quot;IF_NEEDED\u0026quot; export clusterName=\u0026quot;oim_cluster\u0026quot; export configuredManagedServerCount=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; export initialManagedServerReplicas=\u0026quot;1\u0026quot; export managedServerNameBase=\u0026quot;oim_server\u0026quot; export managedServerPort=\u0026quot;14000\u0026quot; export image=\u0026quot;oracle/oig:12.2.1.4.0-8-ol7-211022.0723\u0026quot; export imagePullPolicy=\u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; export imagePullSecretName=\u0026quot;oig-docker\u0026quot; export productionModeEnabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export weblogicCredentialsSecretName=\u0026quot;oig-domain-credentials\u0026quot; export includeServerOutInPodLog=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; export logHome=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/governancedomain\u0026quot; export t3ChannelPort=\u0026quot;30012\u0026quot; export exposeAdminT3Channel=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export adminNodePort=\u0026quot;30701\u0026quot; export exposeAdminNodePort=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; export namespace=\u0026quot;oigns\u0026quot; javaOptions=-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false export persistentVolumeClaimName=\u0026quot;governancedomain-domain-pvc\u0026quot; export domainPVMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptsMountPath=\u0026quot;/u01/weblogic\u0026quot; export createDomainScriptName=\u0026quot;create-domain-job.sh\u0026quot; export createDomainFilesDir=\u0026quot;wlst\u0026quot; export rcuSchemaPrefix=\u0026quot;OIGK8S\u0026quot; export rcuDatabaseURL=\u0026quot;slc12cpn.us.oracle.com:1521/orcl.us.oracle.com\u0026quot; export rcuCredentialsSecret=\u0026quot;oig-rcu-credentials\u0026quot; export frontEndHost=\u0026quot;masternode.example.com\u0026quot; export frontEndPort=\u0026quot;14100\u0026quot; Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/create-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/delete-domain-job.yaml Generating output/weblogic-domains/governancedomain/domain.yaml Checking to see if the secret governancedomain-domain-credentials exists in namespace oigns configmap/governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm created Checking the configmap governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm was created configmap/governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm labeled Checking if object type job with name governancedomain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job exists No resources found in oigns namespace.

	"content": "If you have access to the My Oracle Support (MOS), and there is a need to build a new image with a patch (bundle or interim), it is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build an Oracle SOA Suite image for production deployments.\n Create or update an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Create an image Update an image   Create an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image using Dockerfile  Create or update an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool Using the WebLogic Image Tool, you can create a new Oracle SOA Suite Docker image (can include patches as well) or update an existing image with one or more patches (bundle patch and interim patches).\n Recommendations:\n Use create for creating a new Oracle SOA Suite Docker image either:  without any patches or, containing the Oracle SOA Suite binaries, bundle patch and interim patches. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the Oracle SOA Suite patches because it optimizes the size of the image.   Use update for patching an existing Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache Set up additional build scripts  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location.  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it. In these steps, this directory is imagetool-setup.\n$ mkdir imagetool-setup $ cd imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file to the imagetool-setup directory.\n  Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool on a Linux environment:\n$ cd imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle SOA Suite Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git   Copy the additional WebLogic Image Tool build files from the operator source repository to the imagetool-setup location:\n$ mkdir -p imagetool-setup/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0 $ cd imagetool-setup/docker-images/OracleSOASuite/imagetool/12.2.1.4.0 $ cp -rf ${WORKDIR}/imagetool-scripts/* .    Note: If you want to create the image continue with the following steps, otherwise to update the image see update an image.\n Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool and required build scripts, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle SOA Suite Docker image.\nDownload the Oracle SOA Suite installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle SOA Suite installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice.

Consult the README file for important prerequisite steps, such as building or pulling the Server JRE Docker image, Oracle FMW Infrastructure Docker image, and downloading the Oracle SOA Suite installer and bundle patch binaries.\nA prebuilt Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4, is available at container-registry.oracle.com. We recommend that you pull and rename this image to build the Oracle SOA Suite image.\n$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 $ docker tag container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.0 Follow these steps to build an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, and then the Oracle SOA Suite image as a layer on top of that:\n  Make a local clone of the sample repository:\n$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images   Build the oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 image:\n$ cd docker-images/OracleFMWInfrastructure/dockerfiles $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4 -s This will produce an image named oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.\n  Tag the image as follows:\n$ docker tag oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4 oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.0   Download the Oracle SOA Suite installer from the Oracle Technology Network or e-delivery.\n Note: Copy the installer binaries to the same location as the Dockerfile.\n   To build the Oracle SOA Suite image with patches, you must download and drop the patch zip files (for example, p29928100_122140_Generic.zip) into the patches/ folder under the version that is required. For example, for 12.2.1.4.0 the folder is 12.2.1.4/patches. Similarly, to build the image by including the OPatch patch, download and drop the OPatch patch zip file (for e.g. p28186730_139424_Generic.zip) into the opatch_patch/ folder.\n  Create the Oracle SOA Suite image by running the provided script:\n$ cd docker-images/OracleSOASuite/dockerfiles $ ./buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4 -s The image produced will be named oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4. The samples and instructions assume the Oracle SOA Suite image is named soasuite:12.2.1.4. You must rename your image to match this name, or update the samples to refer to the image you created.\n$ docker tag oracle/soasuite:12.2.1.4 soasuite:12.2.1.4   "

Oracle Unified Directory is an all-in-one directory solution with storage, proxy, synchronization and virtualization capabilities. While unifying the approach, it provides all the services required for high-performance Enterprise and carrier-grade environments. Oracle Unified Directory ensures scalability to billions of entries, ease of installation, elastic deployments, enterprise manageability and effective monitoring.\nThis project supports deployment of Oracle Unified Directory (OUD) Docker images based on the 12cPS4 (12.2.1.4.0) release within a Kubernetes environment. The OUD Docker Image refers to binaries for OUD Release 12.2.1.4.0 and it has the capability to create different types of OUD Instances (Directory Service, Proxy, Replication) in containers.\nImage: oracle/oud:12.2.1.4.0\nThis project has several key features to assist you with deploying and managing Oracle Unified Directory in a Kubernetes environment. You can:\n Create Oracle Unified Directory instances in a Kubernetes persistent volume (PV). This PV can reside in an NFS file system or other Kubernetes volume types. Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states. Expose the Oracle Unified Directory services for external access. Scale Oracle Unified Directory by starting and stopping servers on demand. Monitor the Oracle Unified Directory instance using Prometheus and Grafana.  Follow the instructions in this guide to set up Oracle Unified Directory on Kubernetes.\nGetting started For detailed information about deploying Oracle Unified Directory, start at Prerequisites and follow this documentation sequentially.\nIf performing an Enterprise Deployment, refer to the Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management in a Kubernetes Cluster instead.\nCurrent release The current production release for Oracle Unified Directory 12c PS4 (12.2.1.4.0) deployment on Kubernetes is 21.4.2.\n"

You can control this access using a combination of network channels and firewalls.\n You can create T3/T3S channels and the corresponding Kubernetes service to expose the T3/T3S protocol for the Administration Server and Managed Servers in an Oracle SOA Suite domain.\nThe WebLogic Kubernetes Operator provides an option to expose a T3 channel for the Administration Server using the exposeAdminT3Channel setting during domain creation, then the matching T3 service can be used to connect. By default, when exposeAdminT3Channel is set, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment exposes the NodePort for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint at 30012 (use t3ChannelPort to configure the port to a different value).\nIf you miss enabling exposeAdminT3Channel during domain creation, follow these steps to create a T3 channel for Administration Server manually.\nExpose a T3/T3S Channel for the Administration Server To create a custom T3/T3S channel for the Administration Server that has a listen port listen_port and a paired public port public_port:\n  Create t3_admin_config.py with the following content:\nadmin_pod_name = sys.argv[1] admin_port = sys.argv[2] user_name = sys.argv[3] password = sys.argv[4] listen_port = sys.argv[5] public_port = sys.argv[6] public_address = sys.argv[7] AdminServerName = sys.argv[8] channelType = sys.argv[9] print(\u0026#39;custom admin_pod_name : [%s]\u0026#39;

Send the CSR to your certificate authority (CA) to generate the certificate.\nIf you want to use a certificate for testing purposes you can generate a self signed certificate using openssl:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/ssl $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/ssl $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj \u0026#34;/CN=\u0026lt;nginx-hostname\u0026gt;\u0026#34; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/OAMK8S/ssl $ cd /scratch/OAMK8S/ssl $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj \u0026#34;/CN=masternode.example.com\u0026#34; Note: The CN should match the host.domain of the master node in order to prevent hostname problems during certificate verification.\nThe output will look similar to the following:\nGenerating a 2048 bit RSA private key ..........................................+++ .......................................................................................................+++ writing new private key to 'tls.key' -----   Create a secret for SSL by running the following command:\n$ kubectl -n oamns create secret tls \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-tls-cert --key \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/tls.key --cert \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/tls.crt For example:\n$ kubectl -n oamns create secret tls accessdomain-tls-cert --key /scratch/OAMK8S/ssl/tls.key --cert /scratch/OAMK8S/ssl/tls.crt The output will look similar to the following:\nsecret/accessdomain-tls-cert created   Install NGINX Use helm to install NGINX.\n  Add the helm chart repository for NGINX using the following command:\n$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx The output will look similar to the following:\n\u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; has been added to your repositories   Update the repository using the following command:\n$ helm repo update The output will look similar to the following:\nHang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈   Install NGINX using helm If you can connect directly to the master node IP address from a browser, then install NGINX with the --set controller.service.type=NodePort parameter.\nIf you are using a Managed Service for your Kubernetes cluster, for example Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and connect from a browser to the Load Balancer IP address, then use the --set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer parameter. This instructs the Managed Service to setup a Load Balancer to direct traffic to the NGINX ingress.\n  To install NGINX use the following helm command depending on if you are using NodePort or LoadBalancer:\na) Using NodePort\n$ helm install nginx-ingress -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; --set controller.extraArgs.default-ssl-certificate=\u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;ssl_secret\u0026gt; --set controller.service.type=NodePort --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false stable/ingress-nginx For example:\n$ helm install nginx-ingress -n oamns --set controller.extraArgs.default-ssl-certificate=oamns/accessdomain-tls-cert --set controller.service.type=NodePort --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false stable/ingress-nginx Note: If using Kubernetes 1.18 then add --version=3.34.0 to the end of command.\nThe output will look similar to the following:\nNAME: nginx-ingress LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov 1 07:34:25 2021 NAMESPACE: oamns STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The nginx-ingress controller has been installed.

See Monitoring a domain.\nThe WebLogic Monitoring Exporter uses the WLS RESTful Management API to scrape runtime information and then exports Prometheus-compatible metrics. It is deployed as a web application in a WebLogic Server (WLS) instance, version 12.2.1 or later, typically, in the instance from which you want to get metrics.\nThere are two ways to setup monitoring and you should choose one method or the other:\n Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh Setup using manual configuration  Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh The $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/setup-monitoring.sh sets up the monitoring for the OIG domain. It installs Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and deploys the web applications to the OIG domain. It also deploys the WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard.\nFor usage details execute ./setup-monitoring.sh -h.\n  Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/monitoring-inputs.yaml and change the domainUID, domainNamespace, and weblogicCredentialsSecretName to correspond to your deployment.

For example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: basic-auth namespace: oigns data: password: V2VsY29tZTE= user: d2VibG9naWM= type: Opaque --- apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: wls-exporter namespace: oigns labels: k8s-app: wls-exporter release: monitoring spec: namespaceSelector: matchNames: - oigns selector: matchLabels: weblogic.domainName: governancedomain endpoints: - basicAuth: password: name: basic-auth key: password username: name: basic-auth key: user port: default relabelings: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) interval: 10s honorLabels: true path: /wls-exporter/metrics   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleSpecific-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OIG namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oigns rules: - apiGroups: - \u0026quot;\u0026quot; resources: - services - endpoints - pods verbs: - get - list - watch kind: RoleList   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleBinding-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace` to match your OIG namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oigns roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: prometheus-k8s subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: prometheus-k8s namespace: monitoring kind: RoleBindingList   Run the following command to enable Prometheus:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests $ kubectl apply -f . The output will look similar to the following:\nrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created secret/basic-auth created servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/wls-exporter created   Prometheus service discovery After the ServiceMonitor is deployed, the wls-exporter should be discovered by Prometheus and be able to collect metrics.\n  Access the following URL to view Prometheus service discovery: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32101/service-discovery\n  Click on oigns/wls-exporter/0 and then show more. Verify all the targets are mentioned.\n  Note: It may take several minutes for oigns/wls-exporter/0 to appear, so refresh the page until it does.\nGrafana dashboard   Access the Grafana dashboard with the following URL: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32100 and login with admin/admin. Change your password when prompted.\n  Import the Grafana dashboard by navigating on the left hand menu to Create \u0026gt; Import. Copy the content from $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/config/weblogic-server-dashboard-import.json and paste. Then click Load and Import. The dashboard should be displayed.\n  Cleanup To clean up a manual installation:\n  Run the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/ $ kubectl delete -f .   Delete the deployments:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/scripts/ $ kubectl cp undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:/u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy $ kubectl exec -it -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver -- /u01/oracle/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh /u01/oracle/wls-exporter-deploy/undeploy-weblogic-monitoring-exporter.py -domainName \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -adminServerName AdminServer -adminURL \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt;-adminserver:7001 -username weblogic -password \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -oimClusterName oim_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTooimCluster true -soaClusterName soa_cluster -wlsMonitoringExporterTosoaCluster true   Delete Prometheus:\n  $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/kube-prometheus $ kubectl delete -f manifests $ kubectl delete -f manifests/setup "

	"description": "This section describes known issues for Oracle SOA Suite domains deployment on Kubernetes. Also, provides answers to frequently asked questions.",
	"content": "Overriding tuning parameters is not supported using configuration overrides The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator enables you to override some of the domain configuration using configuration overrides (also called situational configuration). See supported overrides. Overriding the tuning parameters such as MaxMessageSize and PAYLOAD, for Oracle SOA Suite domains is not supported using the configuration overrides feature. However, you can override them using the following steps:\n  Specify the new value using the environment variable K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES in serverPod.env section in domain.yaml configuration file (example path: \u0026lt;domain-creation-output-directory\u0026gt;/weblogic-domains/soainfra/domain.yaml) based on the servers to which the changes are to be applied.\nFor example, to override the value at the Administration Server pod level:\nspec: adminServer: serverPod: env: - name: K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES value: \u0026#34;-Dweblogic.MaxMessageSize=78787878\u0026#34; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms512m -Xmx1024m \u0026#39; serverStartState: RUNNING For example, to override the value at a specific cluster level (soa_cluster or osb_cluster):\n- clusterName: soa_cluster serverService: precreateService: true serverStartState: \u0026#34;RUNNING\u0026#34; serverPod: env: - name: K8S_REFCONF_OVERRIDES value: \u0026#34;-Dsoa.payload.threshold.kb=102410\u0026#34;  Note: When multiple system properties are specified for serverPod.env.value, make sure each system property is separated by a space.\n   Apply the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: The server pod(s) will be automatically restarted (rolling restart).\n   Deployments in the WebLogic Server Administration Console may display unexpected error In an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using the operator, accessing Deployments from the WebLogic Server Administration Console home page may display the error message Unexpected error encountered while obtaining monitoring information for applications. This error does not have any functional impact and can be ignored. You can verify that the applications are in Active state from the Control tab in Summary of deployments page.\nEnterprise Manager Console may display ADF_FACES-30200 error In an Oracle SOA Suite environment deployed using the operator, the Enterprise Manager Console may intermittently display the following error when the domain servers are restarted:\nADF_FACES-30200: For more information, please see the server\u0026#39;s error log for an entry beginning with: The UIViewRoot is null. Fatal exception during PhaseId: RESTORE_VIEW 1. You can refresh the Enterprise Manager Console URL to successfully log in to the Console.\nConfigure the external URL access for Oracle SOA Suite composite applications For Oracle SOA Suite composite applications to access the external URLs over the internet (if your cluster is behind a http proxy server), you must configure the following proxy parameters for Administration Server and Managed Server pods.\n-Dhttp.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttps.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\u0026#34;localhost|soainfra-adminserver|soainfra-soa-server1|soainfra-osb-server1|...soainfra-soa-serverN|*.svc.cluster.local|*.your.domain.com|/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; To do this, edit the domain.yaml configuration file and append the proxy parameters to the spec.serverPod.env.JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable value.\nFor example:\nserverPod: env: - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false -Dweblogic.ssl.Enabled=true -Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true -Dhttp.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttps.proxyHost=www-your-proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxy-port -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\u0026#34;localhost|soainfra-adminserver|soainfra-soa-server1|soainfra-osb-server1|...soainfra-soa-serverN|*.svc.cluster.local|*.your.domain.com|/var/run/docker.sock\u0026#34; - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms256m -Xmx1024m \u0026#39; volumeMounts:  Note: The -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts parameter must have the pod names of the Administration Server and each Managed Server. For example: soainfra-adminserver, soainfra-soa-server1, soainfra-osb-server1, and so on.\n Apply the updated domain.yaml file:\n$ kubectl apply -f domain.yaml  Note: The server pod(s) will be automatically restarted (rolling restart).\n Configure the external access for the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler WebServices WSDL URLs In an Oracle SOA Suite domain deployed including the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS) component, the following ESS WebServices WSDL URLs shown in the table format in the ess/essWebServicesWsdl.jsp page are not reachable outside the Kubernetes cluster.\nESSWebService EssAsyncCallbackService EssWsJobAsyncCallbackService Follow these steps to configure the external access for the Oracle Enterprise Scheduler WebServices WSDL URLs:\n Log in to the Administration Console URL of the domain.\nFor example: http://\u0026lt;LOADBALANCER-HOST\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/console In the Home Page, click Clusters. Then click the soa_cluster. Click the HTTP tab and then click Lock \u0026amp; Edit in the Change Center panel. Update the following values:  Frontend Host: host name of the load balancer. For example, domain1.example.com. Frontend HTTP Port: load balancer port. For example, 30305. Frontend HTTPS Port: load balancer https port. For example, 30443.   Click Save. Click Activate Changes in the Change Center panel. Restart the servers in the SOA cluster.   Note: Do not restart servers from the Administration Console.\n Missing gif images in Oracle Service Bus console pipeline configuration page In an Oracle SOA Suite domain environment upgraded to the release 21.1.2, some gif images are not rendered in the Oracle Serice Bus console pipeline configuration page, as their corresponding url paths are not exposed via the Ingress path rules in the earlier releases (for Non-SSL and SSL termination). To resolve this issue, perform the following steps to apply the latest ingress configuration:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade \u0026lt;helm_release_for_ingress\u0026gt; \\ charts/ingress-per-domain \\ --namespace \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; \\ --reuse-values  Note: helm_release_for_ingress is the ingress name used in the corresponding helm install command for the ingress installation.\n For example, to upgrade the NGINX based ingress configuration:\n$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade soa-nginx-ingress \\ charts/ingress-per-domain \\ --namespace soans \\ --reuse-values WebLogic Kubernetes Operator FAQs See the general frequently asked questions for using the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\n"

This location by default will be in ${ORACLE_HOME}/soa/soa which is not under Persistent Volume (PV). Therefore, provide the domain\u0026rsquo;s PV location such as {DOMAIN_HOME}/soainfra/servers.\nNow the Plan.xml will be persisted under this location for each Managed Server.\n  Method 2: Customize the Adapter file on the Worker Node:   Copy ABC.rar from the server pod to a PV path:\n$ kubectl cp \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;SOA Managed Server pod name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;full path of .rar file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;destination path inside PV\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl cp soans/soainfra-soa-server1:/u01/oracle/soa/soa/connectors/ABC.rar ${DockerVolume}/domains/soainfra/servers/ABC.rar or do a normal file copy between these locations after entering (using kubectl exec) in to the Managed Server pod.\n  Unrar ABC.rar.\n  Update the new connection details in the weblogic-ra.xml file under META_INF.\n  In the WebLogic Administration Console, under Deployments, select ABC.rar, then Update.\n  Select the ABC.rar path as the new location, which is ${DOMAIN_HOME}/user_projects/domains/soainfra/servers/ABC.rar and click Update.\n  Verify that the plan.xml or updated .rar should be persisted in the PV.\n  "

Obtain the certificate from the Administration Server to be used for a secured (t3s) connection from the client by exporting the certificate from the Administration Server using WLST commands. Sample commands to export the default demoidentity:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin [oracle@helper bin]$ ./wlst.sh . . wls:/offline\u0026gt; connect('weblogic','\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;','t3://soainfra-adminserver:7001') . . wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc = getOpssService(name='KeyStoreService') wls:/soainfra/serverConfig/\u0026gt; svc.exportKeyStoreCertificate(appStripe='system', name='demoidentity', password='DemoIdentityKeyStorePassPhrase', alias='DemoIdetityKeyStorePassPhrase', type='Certificate', filepath='/tmp/cert.txt/') These commands download the certificate for the default demoidentity certificate at /tmp/cert.txt.\nb. Import the certificate to the Java trust store:\n[oracle@helper oracle]$ export JAVA_HOME=/u01/jdk [oracle@helper oracle]$ keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias soadomain -file /tmp/cert.txt -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -keypass changeit -storepass changeit c.

	"content": "As described in Prepare Your Environment you can obtain or build OAM container images in the following ways:\n  Download the latest prebuilt OAM container image from My Oracle Support by referring to the document ID 2723908.1. This image is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle Access Management 12.2.1.4.0 and the latest PSU.\n  Build your own OAM image using the WebLogic Image Tool or by using the dockerfile, scripts and base images from Oracle Container Registry (OCR). You can also build your own image by using only the dockerfile and scripts. Building the OAM Image.\n  If you have access to the My Oracle Support (MOS), and there is a need to build a new image with an interim or one off patch, it is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build an Oracle Access Management image for production deployments.\nCreate or update an Oracle Access Management image using the WebLogic Image Tool Using the WebLogic Image Tool, you can create a new Oracle Access Management image with PSU\u0026rsquo;s and interim patches or update an existing image with one or more interim patches.\n Recommendations:\n Use create for creating a new Oracle Access Management image containing the Oracle Access Management binaries, bundle patch and interim patches. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the OAM patches because it optimizes the size of the image. Use update for patching an existing Oracle Access Management image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Create an image Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it:\n$ mdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle Access Management Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle Access Management domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git    Note: If you want to create the image continue with the following steps, otherwise to update the image see update an image.\n Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle Access Management image.\nDownload the Oracle Access Management installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle Access Management installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice.\nThe installation binaries and patches required are:\n  Oracle Identity and Access Management 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_idm.jar    Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c Infrastructure 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_infrastructure.jar    OAM and FMW Infrastructure Patches:\n View document ID 2723908.1 on My Oracle Support.

	"content": "As described in Prepare Your Environment you can obtain or build OIG container images in the following ways:\n  Download the latest prebuilt OIG container image from My Oracle Support by referring to the document ID 2723908.1. This image is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle Identity Governance 12.2.1.4.0 and the latest PSU.\n  Build your own OIG image using the WebLogic Image Tool or by using the dockerfile, scripts and base images from Oracle Container Registry (OCR). You can also build your own image by using only the dockerfile and scripts. Building the OIG Image.\n  If you have access to the My Oracle Support (MOS), and there is a need to build a new image with an interim or one off patch, it is recommended to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build an Oracle Identity Governance image for production deployments.\nCreate or update an Oracle Identity Governance image using the WebLogic Image Tool Using the WebLogic Image Tool, you can create a new Oracle Identity Governance image with PSU\u0026rsquo;s and interim patches or update an existing image with one or more interim patches.\n Recommendations:\n Use create for creating a new Oracle Identity Governance image containing the Oracle Identity Governance binaries, bundle patch and interim patches. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the OIG patches because it optimizes the size of the image. Use update for patching an existing Oracle Identity Governance image with a single interim patch. Note that the patched image size may increase considerably due to additional image layers introduced by the patch application tool.   Create an image Set up the WebLogic Image Tool  Prerequisites Set up the WebLogic Image Tool Validate setup WebLogic Image Tool build directory WebLogic Image Tool cache  Prerequisites Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n Docker client and daemon on the build machine, with minimum Docker version 18.03.1.ce. Bash version 4.0 or later, to enable the command complete feature. JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the appropriate JDK location e.g: /scratch/export/oracle/product/jdk  Set up the WebLogic Image Tool To set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Create a working directory and change to it:\n$ mkdir \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; $ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt; For example:\n$ mkdir /scratch/imagetool-setup $ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup   Download the latest version of the WebLogic Image Tool from the releases page.\n$ wget https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-X.X.X/imagetool.zip where X.X.X is the latest release referenced on the releases page.\n  Unzip the release ZIP file in the imagetool-setup directory.\n$ unzip imagetool.zip   Execute the following commands to set up the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup/imagetool/bin $ source setup.sh   Validate setup To validate the setup of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n  Enter the following command to retrieve the version of the WebLogic Image Tool:\n$ imagetool --version   Enter imagetool then press the Tab key to display the available imagetool commands:\n$ imagetool \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt; cache create help rebase update   WebLogic Image Tool build directory The WebLogic Image Tool creates a temporary Docker context directory, prefixed by wlsimgbuilder_temp, every time the tool runs. Under normal circumstances, this context directory will be deleted. However, if the process is aborted or the tool is unable to remove the directory, it is safe for you to delete it manually. By default, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the Docker context directory under the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. If you prefer to use a different directory for the temporary context, set the environment variable WLSIMG_BLDDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_BLDDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/buid/dir\u0026#34; WebLogic Image Tool cache The WebLogic Image Tool maintains a local file cache store. This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system. By default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory. You can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; Set up additional build scripts Creating an Oracle Identity Governance Docker image using the WebLogic Image Tool requires additional container scripts for Oracle Identity Governance domains.\n  Clone the docker-images repository to set up those scripts. In these steps, this directory is DOCKER_REPO:\n$ cd \u0026lt;workdir\u0026gt;/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git For example:\n$ cd /scratch/imagetool-setup $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git    Note: If you want to create the image continue with the following steps, otherwise to update the image see update an image.\n Create an image After setting up the WebLogic Image Tool, follow these steps to use the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new Oracle Identity Governance image.\nDownload the Oracle Identity Governance installation binaries and patches You must download the required Oracle Identity Governance installation binaries and patches as listed below from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and save them in a directory of your choice.\nThe installation binaries and patches required are:\n  Oracle Identity and Access Management 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_idm.jar    Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c Infrastructure 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_infrastructure.jar    Oracle SOA Suite for Oracle Middleware 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_soa.jar    Oracle Service Bus 12.2.1.4.0\n fmw_12.2.1.4.0_osb.jar    OIG and FMW Infrastructure Patches:\n View document ID 2723908.1 on My Oracle Support.

To create your namespace, issue the following command:\n$ kubectl create ns oidns namespace/oidns created Deploy OID Helm Chart Create Oracle Internet Directory instances along with Kubernetes objects in a specified namespace using the oid Helm Chart.\nThe deployment can be initiated by running the following Helm command with reference to the oid Helm Chart, along with configuration parameters according to your environment. Before deploying the Helm chart, the namespace should be created. Objects to be created by the Helm chart will be created inside the specified namespace.\n$ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Configuration Parameters\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Helm Chart Path/Name\u0026gt; Configuration Parameters (override values in chart) can be passed on with --set arguments on the command line and/or with -f / --values arguments when referring to files.\nNote: Example files in the sections below provide values which allow the user to override the default values provided by the Helm chart.\n  Navigate to the helm directory for OID under the working directory where the code was cloned.\n  Create a file oidoverride.yaml file with the following contents:\n  image: repository: oracle/oid tag: 12.2.1.4.0 pullPolicy: IfNotPresent oidConfig: realmDN: dc=oid,dc=example,dc=com domainName: oid_domain orcladminPassword: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; dbUser: sys dbPassword: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; dbschemaPassword: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; rcuSchemaPrefix: OIDK8S rcuDatabaseURL: oiddb.example.com:1521/oiddb.example.com sslwalletPassword: welcome2 persistence: type: networkstorage networkstorage: nfs: path: /scratch/shared/oid_user_projects server: \u0026lt;NFS IP address \u0026gt; odsm: adminUser: weblogic adminPassword: welcome3 where: /scratch/shared/oid_user_projects is the hostpath where the pv and pvc will be created.\nCreate the OID instances  To setup a single pod:\nhelm install --namespace oidns --values oidoverride.yaml oid oid --set replicaCount=0 To setup multiple pods increase replicaCount:\nhelm install --namespace oidns --values oidoverride.yaml oid oid --set replicaCount=2 Confirm that the pods and services are running:  To setup a single pod:\nkubectl get all --namespace oidns Output should be similar to the following:\n NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES pod/oidhost1 1/1 Running 0 3h34m 10.244.0.137 myoidhost \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; pod/oidhost2 1/1 Running 0 3h34m 10.244.0.138 myoidhost \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; pod/oidhost3 1/1 Running 0 3h34m 10.244.0.136 myoidhost \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR service/oid-lbr-ldap ClusterIP 10.103.103.151 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 3060/TCP,3131/TCP 3h34m app.kubernetes.io/instance=oid,app.kubernetes.io/name=oid service/oidhost1 ClusterIP 10.108.25.249 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 3060/TCP,3131/TCP,7001/TCP,7002/TCP 3h34m app.kubernetes.io/instance=oid,app.kubernetes.io/name=oid,oid/instance=oidhost1 service/oidhost2 ClusterIP 10.99.99.62 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 3060/TCP,3131/TCP 3h34m app.kubernetes.io/instance=oid,app.kubernetes.io/name=oid,oid/instance=oidhost2 service/oidhost3 ClusterIP 10.107.13.174 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 3060/TCP,3131/TCP 3h34m app.kubernetes.io/instance=oid,app.kubernetes.io/name=oid,oid/instance=oidhost3 Examples Example where configuration parameters are passed with --set argument: $ helm install --namespace oidns \\ --set oidConfig.rootUserPassword=Oracle123,persistence.filesystem.hostPath.path=/scratch/shared/oid_user_projects \\ oid oid  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help.

Ingress Controller Setup There are two types of Ingress controllers supported by this Helm chart. In the sub-sections below, configuration steps for each Controller are described.\nBy default Ingress configuration only supports HTTP and HTTPS Ports/Communication. To allow LDAP and LDAPS communication over TCP, additional configuration is required at Ingress Controller/Implementation level.\nIngress with NGINX Nginx-ingress controller implementation can be deployed/installed in a Kubernetes environment.\nCreate a Kubernetes Namespace Create a Kubernetes namespace to provide a scope for NGINX objects such as pods and services that you create in the environment. To create your namespace, issue the following command:\n$ kubectl create ns mynginx namespace/mynginx created Command helm install to install nginx-ingress related objects like pod, service, deployment, etc. Add repository reference to Helm for retrieving/installing Chart for nginx-ingress implementation.\n$ helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx To install and configure NGINX Ingress issue the following command:\n$ helm install --namespace mynginx \\ --values nginx-ingress-values-override.yaml \\ lbr-nginx \\ ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \\ --version=3.34.0 \\ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false Where:\n  lbr-nginx is your deployment name\n  ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx is the chart reference\n  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help.  The --values argument passes a file path/name which overrides values in the chart.\n  Output will be something like this:\nNAME: lbr-nginx LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Aug 26 20:05:41 2021 NAMESPACE: mynginx STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The ingress-nginx controller has been installed.

	"content": " Introduction Deploy oud-ds-rs Helm Chart Verify the Replication Ingress Controller Setup  Ingress with NGINX   Access to Interfaces through Ingress Configuration Parameters  Introduction This Helm chart provides for the deployment of replicated Oracle Unified Directory (DS+RS) instances on Kubernetes.\nThis chart can be used to deploy an Oracle Unified Directory instance as a base, with configured sample entries, and multiple replicated Oracle Unified Directory instances/pods/services based on the specified replicaCount.\nBased on the configuration, this chart deploys the following objects in the specified namespace of a Kubernetes cluster.\n Service Account Secret Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim Pod(s)/Container(s) for Oracle Unified Directory Instances Services for interfaces exposed through Oracle Unified Directory Instances Ingress configuration  Create Kubernetes Namespace Create a Kubernetes namespace to provide a scope for other objects such as pods and services that you create in the environment. To create your namespace issue the following command:\n$ kubectl create ns oudns namespace/oudns created Deploy oud-ds-rs Helm Chart Create or Deploy a group of replicated Oracle Unified Directory instances along with Kubernetes objects in a specified namespace using the oud-ds-rs Helm Chart.\nThe deployment can be initiated by running the following Helm command with reference to the oud-ds-rs Helm Chart, along with configuration parameters according to your environment. Before deploying the Helm chart, the namespace should be created. Objects to be created by the Helm chart will be created inside the specified namespace.\n$ cd \u0026lt;work directory\u0026gt;/fmw-kubernetes/OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/helm $ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Configuration Parameters\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;deployment/release name\u0026gt; \\ \u0026lt;Helm Chart Path/Name\u0026gt; Configuration Parameters (override values in chart) can be passed on with --set arguments on the command line and/or with -f / --values arguments when referring to files.\nNote: Example files in the sections below provide values which allow the user to override the default values provided by the Helm chart.\nExamples Example where configuration parameters are passed with --set argument: $ helm install --namespace oudns \\ --set oudConfig.rootUserPassword=Oracle123,persistence.filesystem.hostPath.path=/scratch/shared/oud_user_projects,image.repository=oracle/oud,image.tag=12.2.1.4.0-PSU2020July-20200730 \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help. In this example, it is assumed that the command is executed from the directory containing the \u0026lsquo;oud-ds-rs\u0026rsquo; helm chart directory (\u0026lt;work directory\u0026gt;/OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/helm/).  Example where configuration parameters are passed with --values argument: $ helm install --namespace oudns \\ --values oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help. In this example, it is assumed that the command is executed from the directory containing the \u0026lsquo;oud-ds-rs\u0026rsquo; helm chart directory (OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/helm/). The --values argument passes a file path/name which overrides values in the chart.  oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml\noudConfig: rootUserPassword: Oracle123 persistence: type: filesystem filesystem: hostPath: path: /scratch/shared/oud_user_projects Example to scale-up through Helm Chart based deployment: In this example, we are setting replicaCount value to 3. If initially, the replicaCount value was 2, we will observe a new Oracle Unified Directory pod with assosiated services brought up by Kubernetes. So overall, 4 pods will be running now.\nWe have two ways to achieve our goal:\n$ helm upgrade --namespace oudns \\ --set replicaCount=3 \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs OR\n$ helm upgrade --namespace oudns \\ --values oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml\nreplicaCount: 3  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help. In this example, it is assumed that the command is executed from the directory containing the \u0026lsquo;oud-ds-rs\u0026rsquo; helm chart directory (OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/helm/).  Example to apply new Oracle Unified Directory patch through Helm Chart based deployment: In this example, we will apply PSU2020July-20200730 patch on earlier running Oracle Unified Directory version. If we describe pod we will observe that the container is up with new version.\nWe have two ways to achieve our goal:\n$ helm upgrade --namespace oudns \\ --set image.repository=oracle/oud,image.tag=12.2.1.4.0-PSU2020July-20200730 \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs OR\n$ helm upgrade --namespace oudns \\ --values oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help. In this example, it is assumed that the command is executed from the directory containing the \u0026lsquo;oud-ds-rs\u0026rsquo; helm chart directory (OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/helm/).  oud-ds-rs-values-override.yaml\nimage: repository: oracle/oud tag: 12.2.1.4.0-PSU2020July-20200730 Example for using NFS as PV Storage: $ helm install --namespace oudns \\ --values oud-ds-rs-values-override-nfs.yaml \\ oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs  For more details about the helm command and parameters, please execute helm --help and helm install --help. In this example, it is assumed that the command is executed from the directory containing the \u0026lsquo;oud-ds-rs\u0026rsquo; helm chart directory (OracleUnifiedDirectory/kubernetes/helm/).

In the sub-sections below, configuration steps for each Controller are described.\nBy default Ingress configuration only supports HTTP and HTTPS Ports/Communication. To allow LDAP and LDAPS communication over TCP, configuration is required at Ingress Controller/Implementation level.\nIngress with NGINX Nginx-ingress controller implementation can be deployed/installed in a Kubernetes environment.\nCreate a Kubernetes Namespace Create a Kubernetes namespace to provide a scope for NGINX objects such as pods and services that you create in the environment. To create your namespace issue the following command:\n$ kubectl create ns mynginx namespace/mynginx created Add Repo reference to Helm for retrieving/installing Chart for nginx-ingress implementation. $ helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx Confirm the charts available by issuing the following command:\n$ helm search repo | grep nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx 4.0.1 1.0.0 Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a... stable/ingress-nginx 4.0.1 1.0.0 Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a... Command helm install to install nginx-ingress related objects like pod, service, deployment, etc. To install and configure NGINX Ingress issue the following command:\n$ helm install --namespace mynginx \\ --values nginx-ingress-values-override.yaml \\ lbr-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --version=3.34.0 Where:\n lbr-nginx is your deployment name ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx is the chart reference  Output will be similar to the following:\n$ helm install --namespace mynginx --values samples/nginx-ingress-values-override.yaml lbr-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --version=3.34.0 NAME: lbr-nginx LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Oct 7 08:07:29 2020 NAMESPACE: mynginx STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The ingress-nginx controller has been installed.

Verify the Installation Ingress Controller Setup There are two types of Ingress controllers supported by this Helm chart. In the sub-sections below, configuration steps for each Controller are described.\nBy default Ingress configuration only supports HTTP and HTTPS Ports/Communication. To allow LDAP and LDAPS communication over TCP, configuration is required at Ingress Controller/Implementation level.\nIngress with NGINX Nginx-ingress controller implementation can be deployed/installed in Kubernetes environment.\nCreate a Kubernetes Namespace Create a Kubernetes namespace to provide a scope for NGINX objects such as pods and services that you create in the environment. To create your namespace issue the following command:\n$ kubectl create ns mynginx namespace/mynginx created Add Repo reference to helm for retriving/installing Chart for nginx-ingress implementation. $ helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx Confirm the charts available by issuing the following command:\n$ helm search repo | grep nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx 4.0.1 1.0.0 Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a... stable/ingress-nginx 4.0.1 1.0.0 Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a...

Using ELK we can gain insights in real-time from the log data from your applications.\n Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected. Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. It gives you the freedom to select the way you give shape to your data. And you don’t always have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.  Installation ELK can be enabled for environments created using the Helm charts provided with this project. The example below will demonstrate installation and configuration of ELK for the oud-ds-rs chart.\nEnable Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana Edit logging-override-values.yaml and set the enabled flag for each component to \u0026lsquo;true\u0026rsquo;.\nelk: elasticsearch: enabled: true ... kibana: enabled: true ... logstash: enabled: true ... elkVolume: # If enabled, it will use the persistent volume. # if value is false, PV and PVC would not be used and there would not be any mount point available for config enabled: true type: networkstorage networkstorage: nfs: server: myserver path: /scratch/oud_elk_data Note: if elkVolume.enabled is set to \u0026lsquo;true\u0026rsquo; you should supply a directory for the ELK log files. The userid for the directory can be anything but it must have uid:guid as 1000:1000, which is the same as the ‘oracle’ user running in the container. This ensures the ‘oracle’ user has access to the shared volume/directory.\nInstall or Upgrade Oracle Unified Directory Container with ELK Configuration If you have not installed the oud-ds-rs chart then you should install with the following command, picking up the ELK configuration from the previous steps:\n$ helm install --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; --values \u0026lt;valuesfile.yaml\u0026gt; \u0026lt;releasename\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs For example:\n$ helm install --namespace oudns --values logging-override-values.yaml oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs If the oud-ds-rs chart is already installed then update the configuration with the ELK configuration from the previous steps:\n$ helm upgrade --namespace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; --values \u0026lt;valuesfile.yaml\u0026gt; \u0026lt;releasename\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs For example:\n$ helm upgrade --namespace oudns --values logging-override-values.yaml oud-ds-rs oud-ds-rs Configure ElasticSearch List the PODs in your namespace:\n$ kubectl get pods -o wide -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -o wide -n oudns Output will be similar to the following:\n$ kubectl get pods -o wide -n oudns NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES oud-ds-rs-0 1/1 Running 0 39m 10.244.1.107 10.89.73.203 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs-1 1/1 Running 0 39m 10.244.1.108 10.89.73.203 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs-2 1/1 Running 0 39m 10.244.1.106 10.89.73.203 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs-es-cluster-0 1/1 Running 0 39m 10.244.1.109 10.89.73.203 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs-kibana-665f9d5fb-pmz4v 1/1 Running 0 39m 10.244.1.110 10.89.73.203 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; oud-ds-rs-logstash-756fd7c5f5-kvwrw 1/1 Running 0 39m 10.244.2.103 10.89.73.204 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; From this, identify the ElastiSearch POD, oud-ds-rs-es-cluster-0.\nRun the port-forward command to allow ElasticSearch to be listening on port 9200:\n$ kubectl port-forward oud-ds-rs-es-cluster-0 9200:9200 --namespace=\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; \u0026amp; For example:\n$ kubectl port-forward oud-ds-rs-es-cluster-0 9200:9200 --namespace=oudns \u0026amp; [1] 98458 bash-4.2$ Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9200 -\u0026gt; 9200 Forwarding from [::1]:9200 -\u0026gt; 9200 Verify that ElasticSearch is running by interrogating port 9200:\n$ curl http://localhost:9200 Handling connection for 9200 { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;mike-oud-ds-rs-es-cluster-0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cluster_name\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;OUD-elk\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cluster_uuid\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;H2EBtAlJQUGpV6IkS46Yzw\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot; : { \u0026quot;number\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;6.4.3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;build_flavor\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;build_type\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;tar\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;build_hash\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;fe40335\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;build_date\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;2018-10-30T23:17:19.084789Z\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;build_snapshot\u0026quot; : false, \u0026quot;lucene_version\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;7.4.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minimum_wire_compatibility_version\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;5.6.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minimum_index_compatibility_version\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;5.0.0\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;tagline\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;You Know, for Search\u0026quot; } Verify Using the Kibana Application List the Kibana application service using the following command:\n$ kubectl get svc -o wide -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; | grep kibana For example:\n$ kubectl get svc -o wide -n oudns | grep kibana Output will be similar to the following:\noud-ds-rs-kibana NodePort 10.103.169.218 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5601:31199/TCP 67m app=kibana In this example, the port to access Kibana application via a Web browser will be 31199.\nEnter the following URL in a browser to access the Kibana application:\nhttp://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;NodePort\u0026gt;/app/kibana\nFor example:\nhttp://myserver:31199/app/kibana\nFrom the Kibana Portal navigate to:\nManagement -\u0026gt; Index Patterns\nCreate an Index Pattern using the pattern \u0026lsquo;*\u0026rsquo;\nNavigate to Discover : from here you should be able to see logs from the Oracle Unified Directory environment.\n"

To start more OAM Managed Servers perform the following steps:\n  Run the following kubectl command to edit the domain:\n$ kubectl edit domain \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl edit domain accessdomain -n oamns Note: This opens an edit session for the domain where parameters can be changed using standard vi commands.\n  In the edit session search for clusterName: oam_cluster and look for the replicas parameter. By default the replicas parameter is set to \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; hence two OAM Managed Servers are started (oam_server1 and oam_server2):\n clusters: - clusterName: oam_cluster replicas: 2 serverPod: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: weblogic.clusterName operator: In values: - $(CLUSTER_NAME)   To start more OAM Managed Servers, increase the replicas value as desired. In the example below, two more managed servers will be started by setting replicas to \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo;:\n clusters: - clusterName: oam_cluster replicas: 4 serverPod: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: weblogic.clusterName operator: In values: - $(CLUSTER_NAME)   Save the file and exit (:wq!)\nThe output will look similar to the following:\ndomain.weblogic.oracle/accessdomain edited   Run the following kubectl command to view the pods:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 3h33m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 3h40m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3h25m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 1/1 Running 0 3h25m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3h25m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3h25m accessdomain-oam-server3 0/1 Running 0 9s accessdomain-oam-server4 0/1 Running 0 9s helper 1/1 Running 0 3h55m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-76fb7678f-k8rhq 1/1 Running 0 59m Two new pods (accessdomain-oam-server3 and accessdomain-oam-server4) are started, but currently have a READY status of 0/1. This means oam_server3 and oam_server4 are not currently running but are in the process of starting. The servers will take several minutes to start so keep executing the command until READY shows 1/1:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 3h37m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 3h43m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3h29m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 1/1 Running 0 3h29m accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3h29m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3h29m accessdomain-oam-server3 1/1 Running 0 3m45s accessdomain-oam-server4 1/1 Running 0 3m45s helper 1/1 Running 0 3h59m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-76fb7678f-k8rhq 1/1 Running 0 63m Note: To check what is happening during server startup when READY is 0/1, run the following command to view the log of the pod that is starting:\n$ kubectl logs \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl logs accessdomain-oam-server3 -n oamns   To start more OAM Policy Manager servers, repeat the previous commands but change the replicas parameter for the policy_cluster. In the example below replicas has been increased to \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo;:\n - clusterName: policy_cluster replicas: 2 serverPod: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: weblogic.clusterName operator: In values: - $(CLUSTER_NAME) After saving the changes two new pods will be started (accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 and accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4). After a few minutes they will have a READY status of 1/1. In the example below accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 and accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 are started:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 3h43m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 3h49m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3h35m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 1/1 Running 0 3h35m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 1/1 Running 0 4m18s accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 1/1 Running 0 4m18s accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3h35m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3h35m accessdomain-oam-server3 1/1 Running 0 9m27s accessdomain-oam-server4 1/1 Running 0 9m27s helper 1/1 Running 0 4h4m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-76fb7678f-k8rhq 1/1 Running 0 69m   Stopping/Scaling down OAM Managed Servers As mentioned in the previous section, the number of OAM Managed Servers running is dependent on the replicas parameter configured for the cluster. To stop one or more OAM Managed Servers, perform the following:\n  Run the following kubectl command to edit the domain:\n$ kubectl edit domain \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl edit domain accessdomain -n oamns   In the edit session search for clusterName: oam_cluster and look for the replicas parameter. In the example below replicas is set to \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo;, hence four OAM Managed Servers are started (access-domain-oam_server1 - access-domain-oam_server4):\n clusters: - clusterName: oam_cluster replicas: 4 serverPod: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: weblogic.clusterName operator: In values: - $(CLUSTER_NAME)   To stop OAM Managed Servers, decrease the replicas value as desired. In the example below, we will stop two managed servers by setting replicas to \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo;:\n clusters: - clusterName: oam_cluster replicas: 2 serverPod: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: weblogic.clusterName operator: In values: - $(CLUSTER_NAME)   Save the file and exit (:wq!)\n  Run the following kubectl command to view the pods:\n$ kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pods -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 3h45m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 3h51m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3h37m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 1/1 Running 0 3h37m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 1/1 Running 0 6m18s accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 1/1 Running 0 6m18s accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3h37m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3h37m accessdomain-oam-server3 1/1 Running 0 11m accessdomain-oam-server4 1/1 Terminating 0 11m helper 1/1 Running 0 4h6m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-76fb7678f-k8rhq 1/1 Running 0 71m One pod now has a STATUS of Terminating (accessdomain-oam-server4). The server will take a minute or two to stop. Once terminated the other pod (accessdomain-oam-server3) will move to Terminating and then stop. Keep executing the command until the pods have disappeared:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE accessdomain-adminserver 1/1 Running 0 3h48m accessdomain-create-oam-infra-domain-job-7c9r9 0/1 Completed 0 3h54m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr1 1/1 Running 0 3h40m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr2 1/1 Running 0 3h40m accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr3 1/1 Running 0 9m18s accessdomain-oam-policy-mgr4 1/1 Running 0 9m18s accessdomain-oam-server1 1/1 Running 0 3h40m accessdomain-oam-server2 1/1 Running 0 3h40m helper 1/1 Running 0 4h9m nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-76fb7678f-k8rhq 1/1 Running 0 74m   To stop OAM Policy Manager servers, repeat the previous commands but change the replicas parameter for the policy_cluster.

following:\n\u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; has been added to your repositories   Update the repository using the following command:\n$ helm repo update The output will look similar to the following:\nHang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. Happy Helming!   Create a namespace   Create a Kubernetes namespace for NGINX:\n$ kubectl create namespace nginxssl The output will look similar to the following:\nnamespace/nginxssl created   Install NGINX using helm If you can connect directly to the master node IP address from a browser, then install NGINX with the --set controller.service.type=NodePort parameter.\nIf you are using a Managed Service for your Kubernetes cluster, for example Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and connect from a browser to the Load Balancer IP address, then use the --set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer parameter. This instructs the Managed Service to setup a Load Balancer to direct traffic to the NGINX ingress.\n  To install NGINX use the following helm command depending on if you are using NodePort or LoadBalancer:\na) Using NodePort\n$ helm install nginx-ingress -n nginxssl --set controller.extraArgs.default-ssl-certificate=oigns/governancedomain-tls-cert --set controller.service.type=NodePort --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false stable/ingress-nginx Note: If using Kubernetes 1.18 then add --version=3.34.0 to the end of command.\nThe output will look similar to the following:\n$ helm install nginx-ingress -n nginxssl --set controller.extraArgs.default-ssl-certificate=oigns/governancedomain-tls-cert --set controller.service.type=NodePort --set controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false stable/ingress-nginx NAME: nginx-ingress LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov 15 02:23:30 2021 NAMESPACE: nginxssl STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The nginx-ingress controller has been installed.

If you want to enable access logs then set this value to true before executing the command. Enabling access-logs can cause issues with disk space if not regularly maintained.\nFor example:\n$ cd $WORKDIR $ helm install governancedomain-nginx kubernetes/charts/ingress-per-domain --namespace oigns --values kubernetes/charts/ingress-per-domain/values.yaml The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME: governancedomain-nginx LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov 15 02:35:05 2021 NAMESPACE: oigns STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None   Run the following command to show the ingress is created successfully:\n$ kubectl get ing -n \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;

The logstash pod needs access to the persistent volume of the OAM domain created previously, for example accessdomain-domain-pv. The steps to create the logstash pod are as follows:\n  Obtain the OAM domain persistence volume details:\n$ kubectl get pv -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; For example:\n$ kubectl get pv -n oamns The output will look similar to the following:\nNAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE accessdomain-domain-pv 10Gi RWX Retain Bound oamns/accessdomain-domain-pvc accessdomain-domain-storage-class 23h Make note of the CLAIM value, for example in this case accessdomain-domain-pvc\n  Run the following command to get the mountPath of your domain:\n$ kubectl describe domains \u0026lt;domain_uid\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain_namespace\u0026gt; | grep \u0026#34;Mount Path\u0026#34; For example:\n$ kubectl describe domains accessdomain -n oamns | grep \u0026#34;Mount Path\u0026#34; The output will look similar to the following:\nMount Path: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains   Navigate to the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/elasticsearch-and-kibana directory and create a logstash.yaml file as follows. Change the claimName and mountPath values to match the values returned in the previous commands. Change namespace to your domain namespace e.g oamns:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: logstash-wls namespace: oamns spec: selector: matchLabels: k8s-app: logstash-wls template: # create pods using pod definition in this template metadata: labels: k8s-app: logstash-wls spec: volumes: - name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: accessdomain-domain-pvc - name: shared-logs emptyDir: {} containers: - name: logstash image: logstash:6.6.0 command: [\u0026quot;/bin/sh\u0026quot;] args: [\u0026quot;/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logstash/logstash.conf\u0026quot;] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent volumeMounts: - mountPath: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume - name: shared-logs mountPath: /shared-logs ports: - containerPort: 5044 name: logstash   In the NFS persistent volume directory that corresponds to the mountPath /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains, create a logstash directory. For example:\n$ mkdir -p /scratch/OAMK8S/accessdomainpv/logstash   Create a logstash.conf in the newly created logstash directory that contains the following.

	"content": "After the OAM domain is set up you can monitor the OAM instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See Monitoring a domain.\nThe WebLogic Monitoring Exporter uses the WLS RESTful Management API to scrape runtime information and then exports Prometheus-compatible metrics. It is deployed as a web application in a WebLogic Server (WLS) instance, version 12.2.1 or later, typically, in the instance from which you want to get metrics.\nThere are two ways to setup monitoring and you should choose one method or the other:\n Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh Setup using manual configuration  Setup automatically using setup-monitoring.sh The $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/setup-monitoring.sh sets up the monitoring for the OAM domain. It installs Prometheus, Grafana, WebLogic Monitoring Exporter and deploys the web applications to the OAM domain. It also deploys the WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard.\nFor usage details execute ./setup-monitoring.sh -h.\n  Edit the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/monitoring-inputs.yaml and change the domainUID, domainNamespace, and weblogicCredentialsSecretName to correspond to your deployment. For example:\nversion: create-accessdomain-monitoring-inputs-v1 # Unique ID identifying your domain. # This ID must not contain an underscope (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), and must be lowercase and unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. domainUID: accessdomain # Name of the domain namespace domainNamespace: oamns # Boolean value indicating whether to install kube-prometheus-stack setupKubePrometheusStack: true # Additional parameters for helm install kube-prometheus-stack # Refer https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml for additional parameters # Sample : # additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: --set nodeExporter.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.tls.enabled=false --set prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false additionalParamForKubePrometheusStack: # Name of the monitoring namespace monitoringNamespace: monitoring # Name of the Admin Server adminServerName: AdminServer # # Port number for admin server adminServerPort: 7001 # Cluster name oamClusterName: oam_cluster # Port number for managed server oamManagedServerPort: 14100 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTooamCluster: true # Cluster name policyClusterName: policy_cluster # Port number for managed server policyManagedServerPort: 15100 # WebLogic Monitoring Exporter to Cluster wlsMonitoringExporterTopolicyCluster: true # Boolean to indicate if the adminNodePort will be exposed exposeMonitoringNodePort: true # NodePort to expose Prometheus prometheusNodePort: 32101 # NodePort to expose Grafana grafanaNodePort: 32100 # NodePort to expose Alertmanager alertmanagerNodePort: 32102 # Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Admin Server's username and password weblogicCredentialsSecretName: accessdomain-credentials   Run the following command to setup monitoring.\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service $ ./setup-monitoring.sh -i monitoring-inputs.yaml The output should be similar to the following:\nMonitoring setup in monitoring in progress node/worker-node1 not labeled node/worker-node2 not labeled node/master-node not labeled Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack started \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; has been added to your repositories Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;prometheus-community\u0026quot; chart repository ...Successfully got an update from the \u0026quot;appscode\u0026quot; chart repository Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈ Setup prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack in progress NAME: monitoring LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Nov 18 14:13:49 2021 NAMESPACE: monitoring STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 NOTES: kube-prometheus-stack has been installed.

The Prometheus Operator identifies the targets using service discovery. To get the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter end point discovered as a target, you must create a service monitor pointing to the service.\nThe exporting of metrics from wls-exporter requires basicAuth, so a Kubernetes Secret is created with the user name and password that are base64 encoded. This Secret is used in the ServiceMonitor deployment. The wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml has basicAuth with credentials as username: weblogic and password: \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; in base64 encoded.\n  Run the following command to get the base64 encoded version of the weblogic password:\n$ echo -n \u0026#34;\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | base64 The output will look similar to the following:\nV2VsY29tZTE=   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/wls-exporter-ServiceMonitor.yaml and change the password: value to the value returned above. Also change the namespace: and weblogic.domainName: values to match your OAM namespace and domain name:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: basic-auth namespace: oamns data: password: V2VsY29tZTE= user: d2VibG9naWM= type: Opaque --- apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: wls-exporter namespace: oamns labels: k8s-app: wls-exporter release: monitoring spec: namespaceSelector: matchNames: - oamns selector: matchLabels: weblogic.domainName: accessdomain endpoints: - basicAuth: password: name: basic-auth key: password username: name: basic-auth key: user port: default relabelings: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) interval: 10s honorLabels: true path: /wls-exporter/metrics   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleSpecific-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace to match your OAM namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oamns rules: - apiGroups: - \u0026quot;\u0026quot; resources: - services - endpoints - pods verbs: - get - list - watch kind: RoleList   Update the $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/prometheus-roleBinding-domain-namespace.yaml and change the namespace` to match your OAM namespace. For example:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 items: - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: prometheus-k8s namespace: oamns roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: prometheus-k8s subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: prometheus-k8s namespace: monitoring kind: RoleBindingList   Run the following command to enable Prometheus:\n$ kubectl apply -f . The output will look similar to the following:\nrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/prometheus-k8s created secret/basic-auth created servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/wls-exporter created   Prometheus Service Discovery After the ServiceMonitor is deployed, the wls-exporter should be discovered by Prometheus and be able to collect metrics.\n  Access the following URL to view Prometheus service discovery: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32101/service-discovery\n  Click on oamns/wls-exporter/0  and then show more. Verify all the targets are mentioned.\n  Grafana Dashboard   Access the Grafana dashboard with the following URL: http://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:32100 and login with admin/admin. Change your password when prompted.\n  Import the Grafana dashboard by navigating on the left hand menu to Create \u0026gt; Import. Copy the content from $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/config/weblogic-server-dashboard-import.json and paste. Then click Load and Import. The dashboard should be displayed in the Dashboards panel.\n  Cleanup To clean up a manual installation:\n  Run the following commands:\n$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/monitoring-service/manifests/ $ kubectl delete -f .
