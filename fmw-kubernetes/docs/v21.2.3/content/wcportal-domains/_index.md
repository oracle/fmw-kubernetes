description: "The WebLogic Kubernetes operator (the “operator”) supports deployment of Oracle WebCenter Portal. Follow the instructions in this guide to set up Oracle WebCenter Portal domain on Kubernetes."
---


With the WebLogic Kubernetes operator (operator), you can deploy your Oracle WebCenter Portal on Kubernetes.

In this release, Oracle WebCenter Portal domain is based on the “domain on a persistent volume”
[model](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/), where the domain home is located in a persistent volume.

The operator has several key features to assist you with deploying and managing the Oracle WebCenter Portal domain in a Kubernetes environment. You can:

* Create Oracle WebCenter Portal instances in a Kubernetes PV. This PV can reside in an Network File System (NFS) or other Kubernetes volume types.
* Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states.
* Expose the Oracle WebCenter Portal services for external access.
* Scale Oracle WebCenter Portal domain by starting and stopping Managed Servers on demand, or by integrating with a REST API.
* Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs to Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.
* Monitor the Oracle WebCenter Portal instance using Prometheus and Grafana.
