To clean up the Oracle WebCenter Portal domain setup, follow the steps below.

#### Delete the Generated Domain Home

To remove a domain home that you generated by running the `create-domain.sh` script in your production or testing environment, use the `delete-domain-job.yaml` file located at, `<$WORKDIR>/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-wcp-domain/domain-home-on-pv/output/weblogic-domains/wcp-domain>` directory.

```
$ kubectl create -f delete-domain-job.yaml
```

#### Clean Up the create-domain-job script After Execution Failure
To clean up the `create-domain-job` script:
 
1. Get the create domain job and configmaps:
 
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get configmaps,jobs -n wcpns |grep "create-domain-job"
    ```
2. Delete the job and configmap:
     
    ```bash
    $ kubectl delete job  job.batch/wcp-domain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job -n wcpns
    $ kubectl delete configmap  wcp-domain-create-fmw-infra-sample-domain-job-cm  -n wcpns
    ```
3. Delete the contents of the PV, if any:
 
    ```bash
    $ sudo rm -rf /scratch/kubevolume
