# This is an example of creating an NGINX controller for OUD
#

# Configuration for additional TCP ports to be exposed through Ingress
# Format for each port would be like:
# <PortNumber>: <Namespace>/<Service>
tcp: 
  # Map 1389 TCP port to LBR LDAP service to get requests handled through any available POD/Endpoint serving LDAP Port
  1389: <OUDNS>/<OUD_POD_PREFIX>-oud-ds-rs-lbr-ldap:ldap
  # Map 1636 TCP port to LBR LDAP service to get requests handled through any available POD/Endpoint serving LDAPS Port
  1636: <OUDNS>/<OUD_POD_PREFIX>-oud-ds-rs-lbr-ldap:ldaps
controller:
  admissionWebhooks:
    enabled: false
  class: nginx-oud
  scope:
     namespace: <OUDNS>
     enabled: true
  extraArgs:
    # The secret referred to by this flag contains the default certificate to be used when accessing the catch-all server.
    # If this flag is not provided NGINX will use a self-signed certificate.
    # If the TLS Secret is in different namespace, name can be mentioned as <namespace>/<tlsSecretName>
    default-ssl-certificate: <OUDNS>/<OUD_POD_PREFIX>-oud-ds-rs-tls-cert
  service:
    # controller service external IP addresses
    # externalIPs:
    # To configure Ingress Controller Service as LoadBalancer type of Service
    # Based on the Kubernetes configuration, External LoadBalancer would be linked to the Ingress Controller Service
    type: NodePort
    # Configuration for NodePort to be used for Ports exposed through Ingress
    # If NodePorts are not defied/configured, Node Port would be assigend automatically by Kubernetes
    # These NodePorts are helpful while accessing services directly through Ingress and without having External Load Balancer.
    nodePorts:
      # For HTTP Interface exposed through LoadBalancer/Ingress
      http: <OUD_HTTP_K8>
      # For HTTPS Interface exposed through LoadBalancer/Ingress
      https: <OUD_HTTPS_K8>
      tcp:
        # For LDAP Interface
        1389: <OUD_LDAP_K8>
        # For LDAPS Interface
        1636: <OUD_LDAPS_K8>
