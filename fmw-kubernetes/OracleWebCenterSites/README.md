# Oracle WebCenter Sites on Kubernetes

This directory provides the open source samples which have several key features to assist you with deploying and managing WebCenter Sites in a Kubernetes environment. You can do the following:

* Create WebCenter Sites instances in a Kubernetes persistent volume. This persistent volume can reside in an NFS file system or other Kubernetes volume types.
* Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states.
* Expose the WebCenter Sites Services and Composites for external access.
* Scale WebCenter Sites by starting and stopping Managed Servers on demand, or by integrating with a REST API to initiate scaling based on WLDF, Prometheus, Grafana, or other rules.
* Publish WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.
* Monitor the instance using Prometheus and Grafana

The fastest way to experience WebCenter Sites on WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is to follow the [User guide](https://oracle.github.io/fmw-kubernetes/wcsites-domains/).
