      <description>Oracle releases Oracle SOA Suite images regularly with the latest bundle and recommended interim patches in My Oracle Support (MOS). However, if you need to create images with new bundle and interim patches, you can build these images using the WebLogic Image Tool.
If you have access to the Oracle SOA Suite patches, you can patch an existing Oracle SOA Suite image with a bundle patch and interim patches. Oracle recommends that you use the WebLogic Image Tool to patch the Oracle SOA Suite image.</description>

      <description>To upgrade the WebLogic Kubernetes operator, use the helm upgrade command with new Helm chart and operator image. See the steps here to pull the operator image and set up the Oracle SOA Suite repository that contains the operator chart. To upgrade the operator run the following command:
$ cd ${WORKDIR} $ helm upgrade \ --reuse-values \ --set image=oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.3.0 \ --namespace weblogic-operator-namespace \ --wait \ weblogic-kubernetes-operator \ charts/weblogic-operator  Note: When the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is upgraded from release version 3.</description>

      <description>These instructions describe how to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster created using kubeadm on which an Oracle SOA Suite domain is deployed. A rolling upgrade approach is used to upgrade nodes (master and worker) of the Kubernetes cluster.
It is expected that there will be a down time during the upgrade of the Kubernetes cluster as the nodes need to be drained as part of the upgrade process.
 Prerequisites  Review Prerequisites and ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is ready for upgrade.</description>
