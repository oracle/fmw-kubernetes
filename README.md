# Kubernetes Product Deployment files from Oracle
Oracle is finding ways for organizations using Oracle Fusion Middleware, to move them into the cloud. By embracing industry standards such as containerisation and orchestration, and certifying against tools like Kubernetes. Fusion Middleware is now able to run in cloud-neutral infrastructure.

The scripts to build the Container images are published in GitHub [docker-images](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images) repository.

In addition, we've provided the deployment scripts in this repository to assist you with deploying and managing Fusion Middleware instances in a Container environment.
