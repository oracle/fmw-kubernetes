1. [Login to the Design Console](#login-to-the-design-console)


### Prerequisites

If you haven't already configured an NGINX ingress controller (SSL) for OIG, follow [Using an Ingress with NGINX (SSL)](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl).

Make sure you know the master hostname and ingress port for NGINX before proceeding e.g `https://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:${MASTERNODE-PORT}`. Also make sure you know the Kubernetes secret for SSL that was generated e.g `governancedomain-tls-cert`.


### Setup routing rules for the Design Console ingress

1. Setup routing rules by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   $ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/design-console-ingress
   ```
   

   Edit `values.yaml` and ensure that `tls: SSL` is set. Change `domainUID:` and `secretName:` to match the values for your `<domain_uid>` and your SSL Kubernetes secret, for example:
   
   ```
   # Load balancer type.  Supported values are: NGINX
   type: NGINX
   # Type of Configuration Supported Values are : NONSSL,SSL
   # tls: NONSSL
   tls: SSL
   # TLS secret name if the mode is SSL
   secretName: governancedomain-tls-cert


   # WLS domain as backend to the load balancer
   wlsDomain:
     domainUID: governancedomain
     oimClusterName: oim_cluster
     oimServerT3Port: 14002
   ```

### Create the ingress

1. Run the following command to create the ingress:
   
   ```bash
   $ cd $WORKDIR
   $ helm install governancedomain-nginx-designconsole kubernetes/design-console-ingress  --namespace oigns  --values kubernetes/design-console-ingress/values.yaml
   ```
   
   The output will look similar to the following:

   ```
   NAME: governancedomain-nginx-designconsole
   <DATE>
   NAMESPACE: oigns
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   TEST SUITE: None
   ```

1. Run the following command to show the ingress is created successfully:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl describe ing governancedomain-nginx-designconsole -n <domain_namespace>
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ kubectl describe ing governancedomain-nginx-designconsole -n oigns
   ```
   
   The output will look similar to the following:

   ```  
   Name:             governancedomain-nginx-designconsole
   Namespace:        oigns
   Address:

### Update the T3 channel

1. Log in to the WebLogic Console using `https://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:${MASTERNODE-PORT}/console`.

1. Navigate to **Environment**, click **Servers**, and then select **oim_server1**.

1. Click **Protocols**, and then **Channels**.

1. Click the default T3 channel called **T3Channel**.

1. Click **Lock and Edit**.

1. Set the **External Listen Address** to the ingress controller hostname `${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}`.
  
1. Set the **External Listen Port** to the ingress controller port `${MASTERNODE-PORT}`. 

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Activate Changes.**


### Restart the OIG Managed Server

Restart the OIG Managed Server for the above changes to take effect:

```bash
$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/domain-lifecycle
$ ./restartServer.sh -s oim_server1 -d <domain_uid> -n <domain_namespace>
```

For example:

```bash
$ cd $WORKDIR/kubernetes/domain-lifecycle
./restartServer.sh -s oim_server1 -d governancedomain -n oigns
```

Make sure the <domain_uid>-oim-server1 has a `READY` status of `1/1` before continuing:
   
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n oigns | grep oim-server1   
```

The output will look similar to the following:
   
```
governancedomain-oim-server1                                1/1     Running     0          8m
```
   
### Design Console Client

It is possible to use Design Console from an on-premises install, or from a container image.

#### Using an on-premises installed Design Console

The instructions below should be performed on the client where Design Console is installed.

1. Import the CA certificate into the java keystore

   If in [Generate SSL Certificate](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl#generate-ssl-certificate) you requested a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), then you must import the CA certificate (e.g cacert.crt) that signed your certificate, into the java truststore used by Design Console.

   If in [Generate SSL Certificate](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl#generate-ssl-certificate) you generated a self-signed certicate (e.g tls.crt), you must import the self-signed certificate into the java truststore used by Design Console.

   Import the certificate using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias dc -file <certificate> -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
   ```

   where `<certificate>` is the CA certificate, or self-signed certicate.

1. Once complete follow [Login to the Design Console](#login-to-the-design-console).

#### Using a container image for Design Console


##### Using Docker

The Design Console can be run from a container using X windows emulation.

1. On the parent machine where the Design Console is to be displayed, run `xhost +`.

1. Find which worker node the `<domain>-oim-server1` pod is running. For example:

   ```
   $ kubectl get pods -n oigns -o wide | grep governancedomain-oim-server1 
   ```
   
   The output will look similar to the following:
   
   ```
   governancedomain-oim-server1                                1/1     Running     0          31m     10.244.2.98   worker-node2   
   ```


1. On the worker node returned above e.g `worker-node2`, execute the following command to find the OIG container image name:

   ```bash
   $ docker images
   ```

   Then execute the following command to start a container to run Design Console:

   ```bash
   $ docker run -u root --name oigdcbase -it <image> bash
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ docker run -u root -it --name oigdcbase container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-<January'25> bash
   ```

   This will take you into a bash shell inside the container:
   
   ```bash
   bash-4.2#
   ```
   
1. Inside the container set the proxy, for example:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:80
   ```

1. Install the relevant X windows packages in the container:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# yum install libXext libXrender libXtst
   ```
   
1. Execute the following outside the container to create a new Design Console image from the container:

   ```bash
   $ docker commit <container_name> <design_console_image_name>
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ docker commit oigdcbase oigdc
   ```
   
1. Exit the container bash session:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# exit
   ```
   
1. Start a new container using the Design Console image:

   ```bash
   $ docker run --name oigdc -it oigdc /bin/bash
   ```
   
   This will take you into a bash shell for the container:
   
   ```bash
   bash-4.2#
   ```
   
1. Copy the Ingress CA certificate into the container

   If in [Generate SSL Certificate](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl#generate-ssl-certificate) you requested a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), then you must copy the CA certificate (e.g cacert.crt) that signed your certificate, into the container

   If in [Generate SSL Certificate](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl#generate-ssl-certificate) you generated a self-signed certicate (e.g tls.crt), you must copy the self-signed certificate into the container
   
   **Note**: You will have to copy the certificate over to the worker node where the oigdc image is created before running the following.

   Run the following command outside the container:

   ```bash
   $ cd <workdir>/ssl
   $ docker cp <certificate> <container_name>:/u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/<certificate>
   ```

   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ cd /scratch/OIGK8S/ssl
   $ docker cp tls.crt oigdc:/u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/tls.crt
   ```   

1. Import the certificate using the following command:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# /u01/jdk/bin/keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias dc -file /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/<certificate> -keystore /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts
   ```

   For example:
   
   ```bash
   bash-4.2# /u01/jdk/bin/keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias dc -file /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/tls.crt -keystore /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts
   ```


1. In the container run the following to export the DISPLAY:

   ```bash
   $ export DISPLAY=<parent_machine_hostname:1>
   ```   

1. Start the Design Console from the container:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# cd idm/designconsole
   bash-4.2# sh xlclient.sh
   ```
   
   The Design Console login should be displayed. Now follow [Login to the Design Console](#login-to-the-design-console).

##### Using podman

1. On the parent machine where the Design Console is to be displayed, run `xhost +`.

1. Find which worker node the `<domain>-oim-server1` pod is running. For example:

   ```
   $ kubectl get pods -n oigns -o wide | grep governancedomain-oim-server1 
   ```
   
   The output will look similar to the following:
   
   ```
   governancedomain-oim-server1                                1/1     Running     0          19h   10.244.2.55   worker-node2   <none> 
   ```

1. On the worker node returned above e.g `worker-node2`, execute the following command to find the OIG container image name:

   ```bash
   $ podman images
   ```

   Then execute the following command to start a container to run Design Console:

   ```bash
   $ podman run -u root --name oigdcbase -it <image> bash
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ podman run -u root -it --name oigdcbase container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/oig_cpu:12.2.1.4-jdk8-ol8-<January'25> bash
   ```

   This will take you into a bash shell inside the container:
   
   ```bash
   bash-4.2#
   ```
   
1. Inside the container set the proxy, for example:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:80
   ```

1. Install the relevant X windows packages in the container:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# yum install libXext libXrender libXtst
   ```
   
1. Execute the following outside the container to create a new Design Console image from the container:

   ```bash
   $ podman commit <container_name> <design_console_image_name>
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ podman commit oigdcbase oigdc
   ```
   
1. Exit the container bash session:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# exit
   ```
   
1. Start a new container using the Design Console image:

   ```bash
   $ podman run --name oigdc -it oigdc /bin/bash
   ```
   
   This will take you into a bash shell for the container:
   
   ```bash
   bash-4.2#
   ```
   
1. Copy the Ingress CA certificate into the container

   If in [Generate SSL Certificate](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl#generate-ssl-certificate) you requested a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), then you must copy the CA certificate (e.g cacert.crt) that signed your certificate, into the container

   If in [Generate SSL Certificate](../../configure-ingress/ingress-nginx-setup-for-oig-domain-setup-on-k8s-ssl#generate-ssl-certificate) you generated a self-signed certicate (e.g tls.crt), you must copy the self-signed certificate into the container

   **Note**: You will have to copy the certificate over to the worker node where the oigdc image is created before running the following.

   Run the following command outside the container:

   ```bash
   $ cd <workdir>/ssl
   $  podman cp <certificate> <container_name>:/u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/<certificate>
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ cd /scratch/OIGK8S/ssl
   $ podman cp tls.crt oigdc:/u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/tls.crt
   ```   

1. Inside the container, import the certificate using the following command:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# /u01/jdk/bin/keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias dc -file /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/<certificate> -keystore /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts
   ```

   For example:
   
   ```bash
   bash-4.2# /u01/jdk/bin/keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias dc -file /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/tls.crt -keystore /u01/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts
   ```

1. In the container run the following to export the DISPLAY:

   ```bash
   $ export DISPLAY=<parent_machine_hostname:1>
   ```   

1. Start the Design Console from the container:

   ```bash
   bash-4.2# cd idm/designconsole
   bash-4.2# sh xlclient.sh
   ```
   
   The Design Console login should be displayed. Now follow [Login to the Design Console](#login-to-the-design-console).

#### Login to the Design Console

1. Launch the Design Console and in the Oracle Identity Manager Design Console login page enter the following details: 

   Enter the following details and click Login:
   * `Server URL`: `<url>`
   * `User ID`: `xelsysadm`
   * `Password`: `<password>`.

    where `<url>` is  where `<url>` is `https://${MASTERNODE-HOSTNAME}:${MASTERNODE-PORT}`.

1. If successful the Design Console will be displayed.
